Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).</p><p>The government is currently being funded through April 28 by a&nbsp;stopgap spending bill that was&nbsp;passed <a href=#>in&nbsp;December</a>.</p><p>Already, President Donald Trump’s secretary of Homeland Security has directed his agency&nbsp;to look for funding sources it might already&nbsp;have available as the&nbsp;administration looks for ways to fulfill&nbsp;one of the the president’s top&nbsp;campaign promises. A <a href=#>Morning Consult/POLITICO survey</a> in January found 47 percent of Americans support construction of the wall, while 45 percent do not.</p><p>The Democratic senators said the wall could be expensive and “raises considerable issues that have not been resolved by the Congress or the Department of Homeland Security.”</p><p>Another <a href=#>Morning Consult/POLITICO</a> survey in January showed that support for the wall dropped considerably when&nbsp;the issue of cost was raised. Just 29 percent of registered voters (and&nbsp;53 percent of Republicans) backed constructing the wall if the U.S. must pick up the estimated $8 billion to $14 billion tab. Sixteen percent of voters said the wall should only be built if Mexico pays for it, while a plurality (42 percent) said it should not be built at all.</p><p>Democrats are also calling for Republicans to stick to the terms of a 2015 bipartisan budget agreement, which dictated that any funding that exceeds current non-emergency spending caps should be divided equally between discretionary and defense spending.</p><p>Beyond opposing the wall and extra agents&nbsp;for DHS to deport criminal immigrants (what the Democrats&nbsp;called a “deportation force”), the senators also said they would object to “poison pill riders,” such as a provision that would cut&nbsp;government funding&nbsp;that goes to&nbsp;Planned Parenthood.</p><p>“We strongly oppose the inclusion of such riders in&nbsp;any of the&nbsp;must-pass&nbsp;appropriations bills that&nbsp;fund the government,” they wrote.</p><p>A spokesman for McConnell would not comment on the letter Monday, but in a sit-down interview with Morning Consult in January, the Senate’s top Republican <a href=#>suggested that</a> with Trump in the White House, Democrats lack the necessary leverage to extract concessions in government funding negotiations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhbHxxf45qamirlaOutbGMnZymp5OnrrW%2FjKuYoquVYsCxscKtnKtlo53CtbDOsKVmmp%2Bnsaa%2BjLCYpaRdm8KvsMinnmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
