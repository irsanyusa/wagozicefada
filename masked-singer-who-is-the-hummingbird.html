But what clues do we have about the celebrity under the mask? And who could it be? Keep reading for everything we know!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 8</h2><p>The Masked Singer posted initial clues ahead of the premiere on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> and for the Hummingbird, we saw a flower. More specifically, it looks like a daisy. On the premiere episode, that’s when we really got into the <a href=#>clues</a>! The Hummingbird starts by noting he is “excited for the kickoff of season 8” while he dancing on a football field. He said, “I promise you” he knows a thing about competition…it’s in his DNA. One of the Men in Black walks up holding a speaker.</p><p>Hummingbird got his start with the help go Shaq and formed a patriotic team that “felt like family.” One of the Men in Black tips a cowboy hat at him. We see a laceless football cleat on the screen, then a scoreboard that was 71-0. He said together, this patriotic team “dominated the Super Bowl.” We see one of the Men in Black conducting with Ring Pops on his fingers while Hummingbird claims his career has been a “revelation.” To close, Hummingbird says “here we go, I guess it’s all or nothing!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Hummingbird</h2><p id=block-adeca979-196e-403e-bb95-1765dad45339>Because of the Hummingbird’s clues, many guesses went straight to athletes. Ken thought it could be Peyton Manning under the mask but the audience responded with a “No, Ken!” Then, he shifted focus to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Brady</a>. Ken went off that, guessing Deion Sanders. Then Jenny threw out a few different names of singers, including Rob Thomas, Uncle Kracker, or Chad Kroeger from Nickelback. With the stories surrounding a GOAT being on the season, Tom Brady was mentioned often online. Other predictions include Peyton or Eli Manning, Tim Tebow, Julian Edelman, and Chris Kirkpatrick from NSYNC.</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER’ RETURNS WITH THRILLING FORMAT TWISTS</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Hummingbird on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p id=block-4f540236-784e-4f7a-a2cc-07e1b50dc01b>All the clues and that voice perfectly align for this one, especially considering just how specific some of the clues were! We know that the Hummingbird is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Chris Kirkpatrick from NSYNC!</h3><p>Even though the athlete clues were strong in this one, we know it’s all a diversion. Plus, NSYNC co-headlined the Super Bowl halftime show in 2001 with Aerosmith so that explains it! Here’s our breakdown of the rest of the clues.</p><p>Throughout the clues, there were nods to a bunch of different NSYNC songs and albums. We saw the laceless football cleats, pointing to No Strings Attached, the Ring Pops for the album and song Pop, he said “I promise you,” pulled directly from “This I Promise You,” and “here we go” at the end, one of NSYNC’s most iconic lyrics. And overall, the “patriotic team that felt like family” was the boy band full of stars, NSYNC.</p><p>The “71” on the scoreboard is a reference to the year Chris Kirkpatrick was born, 1971. He mentioned competition being “in his DNA” and this could be alluding to a number of competition shows he’s been on, including Celebrity Big Brother most recently, or the fact that his mom and grandparents were also in the music business. Hummingbird claimed that he “got his start with help from Shaq,” and Shaquille O’Neal actually rented out his Orlando-area mansion to NSYNC to report some of their music in their early days. Lastly, the cowboy hat we saw is a clue pointing to Chris’s participation in the show Gone Country on CMT.</p><p id=block-4f540236-784e-4f7a-a2cc-07e1b50dc01b>Unfortunately, I don’t think we’ll get to hear Hummingbird perform again because he was eliminated by the season premiere Queen, <a href=#>the Harp</a>! She will be the only contestant moving on to the next round.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_Shakira_-Marc-PiaseckiFilmMagic.jpg alt="Shakira Finally Breaks Silence on Split from Gerard Piqué" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer season 8</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZiquq61zaCZoqqUZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
