But she got the high-octane “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Firestarter</a>” on repeat instead.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Obviously Prodigy wasn’t a part of the birth plan, but her husband Pete almost got it right.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Pete had made a birthing tape for me in those days you could record onto tapes. I wanted Enya as I’ve always loved her music,” she tells TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But in the hectic rush to the hospital, poor Pete yanked the wrong audio tape out of the player. “I told him my tape was in the tape machine. I’d been listening to it during last month of pregnancy. Little did I know he had been listening to Prodigy,” she explained.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mills took to Twitter to share her memory in response to Flint’s passing Monday morning.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“So sad about Keith Flint. I gave birth to my eldest son accompanied by ‘Firestarter’ playing away because my husband had in a mad panic, picked up the wrong tape. And instead of giving birth to Enya and ocean sounds it was The Prodigy. I don’t regret it either,” Mills who is a radio presenter on BBC Humberside tweeted.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>So sad about Keith Flint.

But a song fit for delivery room? Not quite.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So everyone was surprised to hear the guitar strains of “Firestarter” blaring out of the machine, but Mills just let it play as she pushed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I was in the throes of pushing and yelled ‘holy hell’ at him. By that stage then, I wouldn’t have been bothered if the actual band was in the room. I just wanted labor to be over.” The midwife just laughed and said she’d “never heard a music choice quite as wild as that.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">By now, dad is out of the dog house for his honest mistake.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I guess enough time has passed for me to forgive him,” she joked. As for Liam, he has grown to be 21 years old and six-foot-seven and is still just as rock and roll.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He has always been a lovely kid but has a stubborn streak. I can only put that down to the musical choice,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWRof3d9jrCmppmeYq%2BirthmnaKqlajBor7Tnqlo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
