But his passing significantly affected one person, <a href=# title="Vin Diesel" data-link=tag>Vin Diesel</a>, his longtime friend and co-star, who was like a&nbsp;brother to&nbsp;the late actor. Even after all these years, Vin has never failed to&nbsp;honor and remember his true friend, who holds a&nbsp;special place in&nbsp;his heart.</p><p><h2>Best friends on-screen and in&nbsp;real life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/381/a55/b3f52b5ed38a23e2cddb2c3677.jpg><p>0070056/Reporter/ East News</p><p>Paul Walker and Vin Diesel first appeared together on-screen in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Fast and the Furious</i></a>, where Walker portrayed Brian O’Conner and Diesel depicted gang leader Dominic Toretto. Along with the emotional bond the movie characters form, the 2&nbsp;actors also started cultivating a&nbsp;sweet <a href=# title=friendship data-link=tag>friendship</a> off-screen that transcended time and space.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/586/493/7e578d5b6f9537efba165c7934.jpg><p>Alex Ribeiro/Broadimage/EAST NEWS</p><p>They forged a&nbsp;genuine friendship at&nbsp;the start of&nbsp;the franchise that persisted throughout the production of&nbsp;the films from 2001 to&nbsp;2013 and lasted for almost 15&nbsp;years. In&nbsp;fact, Diesel is&nbsp;his late friend’s daughter Meadow Walker’s godfather, proving their amazing connection goes beyond the simple co-star relationship.</p><p>“When we&nbsp;first started doing this, we&nbsp;thought we&nbsp;were doing a&nbsp;classic car movie, and we&nbsp;would do&nbsp;one and that would be&nbsp;it,” Diesel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>. Instead, he&nbsp;confessed how unsure of&nbsp;whether the strategy was to&nbsp;make “alternatively, 7, 8, 9, and 10.” Discussing this even further, Diesel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reflected</a> on&nbsp;a&nbsp;promise they had made to&nbsp;one another, saying, “We&nbsp;would take this franchise and end it&nbsp;at&nbsp;Fast&nbsp;10,” Diesel said.</p><p><h2>The tragic incident</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/157/28d/d4d8455373b0e0208dbad84041.jpg><p>Universal/Courtesy Everett Collection/Everett Collection/East News<span>, </span>PHOTOlink/ Courtesy Everett Collection/East News</p><p>On&nbsp;November&nbsp;30, 2013, Walker reached out on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Twitter</a> to&nbsp;let his followers know that the sixth installment of&nbsp;the cherished movie series would soon be&nbsp;available. However, a&nbsp;few hours later, Walker tragically passed away in&nbsp;a&nbsp;car accident.</p><p>Walker was a&nbsp;very well-known philanthropist, and that day, he&nbsp;spent his time at&nbsp;a&nbsp;charitable event. Just like the character he&nbsp;had played, Walker shared the same passion for fast cars. In&nbsp;fact, that very day, Walker and his friend, Roger Rodas, held the charity event at&nbsp;the high-performance car shop they owned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a4/c77/8b146355599563bed71b9439b4.jpg><p>Michael Jade/AdMedia/SIPA/EAST NEWS</p><p>When they left the gathering, Walker was sitting in&nbsp;the passenger seat while Rodas was driving, and suddenly, only a&nbsp;few hundred yards away, the driver lost control of&nbsp;the vehicle. Those present at&nbsp;the event hurried to&nbsp;help, but they were powerless. Walker’s friends watched helplessly as&nbsp;the tragedy quickly spread through the media. Within hours, Walker’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>passing</a> shocked fans all over the world.</p><p><h2>Vin Diesel never goes a&nbsp;day without cherishing his best friend fondly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ca/147/0eef355e30889cf41aa92f0a08.jpg><p>Vin Diesel and Paul Walker were close friends, and when the actor passed away, it&nbsp;devastated Diesel. Losing his best friend forever tore him apart. However, the actor has always tried to&nbsp;keep his memory alive by&nbsp;talking about Walker and their special relationship. In&nbsp;fact, during some interviews, he&nbsp;would frequently cry in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the camera.</p><p>The actor also discussed meeting Walker’s mother the day after the fatal car crash. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that Walker’s mother’s response, in&nbsp;which she expressed regret, surprised him. “I&nbsp;said, ’Why? Why are you saying sorry to&nbsp;me?’ And she said, ’Because you lost your other half.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df7/056/6bf3365ce98354bd3fb2fbff0b.jpg><p>Vin Diesel found it&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;accept that his beloved confidant had suddenly vanished, ceasing to&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;and watch out for one another. Walker was a&nbsp;substantial source of&nbsp;support for him, especially when he&nbsp;helped Diesel restore his relationship with his mother. “You <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spend</a> 15&nbsp;years going from being a&nbsp;nobody to&nbsp;somebody with a&nbsp;brother. And then one day he’s gone, and it’s a&nbsp;very heavy experience.”</p><p><br>Because<i> </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Fast and Furious 7</i></a>&nbsp;was still in&nbsp;the making, Diesel had not even had time to&nbsp;mourn the loss of&nbsp;his friend. After Walker passed away, Diesel was forced to&nbsp;act as&nbsp;though his friend was standing next to&nbsp;him while the movie was being filmed. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>declared</a>, “I’ve been acting all my&nbsp;life, and they don’t teach you in&nbsp;acting how to&nbsp;mourn someone and simultaneously pretend they’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene with you.”</p><p><h2>The unique connection between their families</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d71/fea/660a5c583dbbbd72a134693dd7.jpg><p>The relationship between Walker and Diesel is&nbsp;unbreakable, and despite Walker’s passing, Diesel has continued to&nbsp;be&nbsp;close with his family, giving them a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;their late father’s presence. Additionally, Diesel gave his second daughter the name Pauline as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=tribute data-link=tag>tribute</a> to&nbsp;his deceased friend.</p><p>Both the Diesel and Walker families frequently get together, and a&nbsp;special bond between their daughters shows how friendship can cut across all barriers. Above all, Diesel remained close to&nbsp;Meadow, his goddaughter, whom he&nbsp;said “takes good care” of&nbsp;him.</p><p>“She’s the first person on&nbsp;Father’s Day to&nbsp;wish me&nbsp;Happy Father’s Day,” Diesel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “To&nbsp;see her with my&nbsp;children is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most beautiful things. There are moments when&nbsp;I see her playing with Pauline, and it&nbsp;hits me&nbsp;so&nbsp;deep, ’cause I&nbsp;can only imagine what my&nbsp;brother sees when he&nbsp;sees that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ef/09d/34c01d50a995938d7b79a796db.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the most meaningful tributes Diesel paid to&nbsp;his late friend was walking his daughter Meadow down the aisle. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>single act</a> moved everyone because it&nbsp;showed the actor’s love for Walker and fulfilled a&nbsp;duty that the late father would have had to&nbsp;fulfill if&nbsp;he&nbsp;were still alive.</p><p>“Life’s blessings always follow tragedies in&nbsp;life,” Diesel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> on&nbsp;his Instagram. “Look at&nbsp;this photo, Pablo. It&nbsp;will make you smile. The same angel that you helped me&nbsp;prepare for in&nbsp;the most beautiful way with your brotherly advice is&nbsp;the same angel that precious Meadow asked to&nbsp;be&nbsp;her maid of&nbsp;honor.”</p><p>What is&nbsp;the most generous thing you have ever done for a&nbsp;friend?
