Many of&nbsp;them have proven that, just like any other human in&nbsp;this world, they have aspirations, dreams, and responsibilities at&nbsp;work. Some of&nbsp;them are more open to&nbsp;letting the press and paparazzi, in&nbsp;general, know about their private life and goals, while others have kept it&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret. Whatever their choice&nbsp;is, none of&nbsp;these public figures lead an&nbsp;uninteresting life.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> made a&nbsp;compilation of&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the princesses that are truly appreciated by&nbsp;their people. And it’s not only thanks to&nbsp;their graceful and authentic character but also because of&nbsp;the work they do&nbsp;in&nbsp;their daily lives that brings these royals closer to&nbsp;their people.</p><p><h2>1. Märtha Louise of&nbsp;Norway</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/131/3f6/1e0260588ea93a5b3a83ea42a7.jpg><p>Although the princess is&nbsp;the eldest daughter of&nbsp;King Harald V&nbsp;and Queen Sonja of&nbsp;Norway, she is&nbsp;fourth in&nbsp;the line for succession to&nbsp;the throne behind her younger brother. She finished her studies in&nbsp;physiotherapy in&nbsp;the Netherlands, but never practiced this profession. Her real passion lies in&nbsp;literature and she has even started a&nbsp;business in&nbsp;television storytelling, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;being an&nbsp;author of&nbsp;children’s books. Although she married a&nbsp;Danish writer with whom she had 3&nbsp;daughters, she never gave up&nbsp;her title as&nbsp;<a href=#>princess</a>.</p><p><h2>2. Keisha Omilana of&nbsp;Nigeria</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/43b/5bd/e82fbf564987d7df83acf5d1ea.jpg><p>The beautiful wife of&nbsp;Nigerian Prince Kunle Omilana was actually born in&nbsp;California and entered the world of&nbsp;<a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>model</a> for international clothing and beauty brands. She also has a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;fashion design. She is&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;“working princess” and among her goals as&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the monarchy, she emphasizes the empowerment of&nbsp;women and youth. In&nbsp;2017 she created A&nbsp;Crown of&nbsp;Curls, a&nbsp;project with a&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;care for and maintain curly hair.</p><p><h2>3. Anne, Princess Royal</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2db/5ea/03227450e791dfb3d413fcee9e.jpg><p>Anne Elizabeth Alice Louise is&nbsp;the only female daughter of&nbsp;the current Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;and is&nbsp;in&nbsp;fourteenth place in&nbsp;the line of&nbsp;succession to&nbsp;the throne. The <a href=#>princess</a> always showed interest in&nbsp;horseback riding, and even went so&nbsp;far as&nbsp;to&nbsp;compete representing the United Kingdom with her team at&nbsp;the Montreal Olympics in&nbsp;the 1970s. She has dedicated herself to&nbsp;charity, and for many years she has been the president of&nbsp;a&nbsp;well-known NGO.</p><p><h2>4. Esther Kamatari from Burundi</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ad/78c/e60247577f81777f9a5c5efd48.jpg><p>Although Kamatari retains the title of&nbsp;Princess of&nbsp;Burundi, a&nbsp;country located in&nbsp;East Africa, the monarchy was actually abolished in&nbsp;the 1960s. But Kamatari <a href=#>made her way</a> to&nbsp;Paris. Since then, she has dedicated herself to&nbsp;modeling and she is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;writer.</p><p><h2>5. Catherine, Duchess of&nbsp;Cambridge</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/924/05f/b96e7258208eb32cf39319a810.jpg><p>Formerly known as&nbsp;simply Kate Middleton, Catherine Elizabeth Middleton graduated with a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;Art History and became part of&nbsp;the British monarchy after she married Prince William, Duke of&nbsp;Cambridge. She has one of&nbsp;the most charming smiles in&nbsp;the House of&nbsp;Windsor, and not only is&nbsp;she beautiful on&nbsp;the outside, but one of&nbsp;her tasks as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>duchess</a> has been to&nbsp;give visibility to&nbsp;those who suffer from <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a> problems, among many others. That is&nbsp;why in&nbsp;2016, together with Prince Harry, her husband’s younger brother and the husband of&nbsp;Meghan Markle, she launched the Heads Together campaign.</p><p><h2>6. Elisabeth, Duchess of&nbsp;Brabant</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/275/d69/d9e0bf5cf29a1a1e28112256e2.jpg><p>Elisabeth Thérèse Marie Hélène, Duchess of&nbsp;Brabant and Princess of&nbsp;Belgium, is&nbsp;the first in&nbsp;line of&nbsp;succession to&nbsp;the throne, thanks to&nbsp;the suppression of&nbsp;a&nbsp;law that did not allow women to&nbsp;assume the crown in&nbsp;the old days. This beautiful <a href=#>girl</a> is&nbsp;19&nbsp;years old and is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;receive obligatory military training to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;be&nbsp;queen in&nbsp;the future.</p><p><h2>7. Katherine, Crown Princess of&nbsp;Yugoslavia</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/abc/ea1/5bea755c62a55024f7610a368f.jpg><p>You could say that Katherine Batis is&nbsp;an&nbsp;all-round princess: she was born in&nbsp;Greece, but she also spent part of&nbsp;her childhood in&nbsp;Switzerland. She studied business in&nbsp;the United States and has lived in&nbsp;different regions, including Africa and Australia. This brilliant woman speaks 4&nbsp;languages fluently and is&nbsp;fascinated by&nbsp;literature as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;music. The Crown <a href=#>Princess</a> of&nbsp;Serbia/Yugoslavia has been married to&nbsp;Prince Alexander of&nbsp;Serbia since the 1980s and is&nbsp;his second wife.</p><p><h2>8. Miriam, Dowager Princess of&nbsp;Turnovo, Duchess in&nbsp;Saxony</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/750/918/404e5d5dc199efd3986c6def29.jpg><p>Doña Miriam Ungría y&nbsp;López, a&nbsp;descendant of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Spanish noble family, married Kardam, son of&nbsp;Tsar Simeon II&nbsp;and Prince of&nbsp;Turnovo, who kept his Bulgarian royal title, even though the monarchy was already abolished when he&nbsp;was born. The <a href=#>princess’</a>s passion and craft has always been jewelry design, although she studied history and geography in&nbsp;Madrid. She currently lives in&nbsp;London and dedicates her time to&nbsp;her luxury line of&nbsp;jewelry.</p><p><h2>9. Catharina-Amalia, Princess of&nbsp;Orange</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/43d/7d5/0cae265732b7906e3e5ea7778c.jpg><p>The young Catharina-Amalia of&nbsp;Orange is&nbsp;first in&nbsp;the line of&nbsp;succession to&nbsp;the throne of&nbsp;the Netherlands and is&nbsp;only 17&nbsp;years old. The <a href=#>Princess</a> of&nbsp;Orange speaks 3&nbsp;languages fluently, including Spanish, since her mother, Maxima of&nbsp;the Netherlands, was born in&nbsp;Argentina. She received her entire primary and secondary education in&nbsp;public schools, like her father, King Willem-Alexander.</p><p><h2>10. Princess Sofia, Duchess of&nbsp;Värmland</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/549/47e/2b888753179339071e45fc61b8.jpg><p>Sofia Kristina Hellqvist was probably one of&nbsp;the most multifaceted princesses in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;work before she married Charles Philip, Duke of&nbsp;Värmland. She was a&nbsp;<a href=#>waitress</a> and model and appeared in&nbsp;reality shows, but also opened a&nbsp;yoga center in&nbsp;New York. The princess is&nbsp;also known for having lived in&nbsp;Africa helping those in&nbsp;need, although the latest development that has put her on&nbsp;everyone’s radar screen was her decision to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;volunteer in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hospital.</p><p>Have you ever dreamed of&nbsp;being part of&nbsp;royalty?
