But when Jaqi Clements brought her twin daughters into the world 11&nbsp;years ago, everyone could see that there was something extraordinary about them. Even when they were babies, they were predicted to&nbsp;become models, and today, they are indeed known to&nbsp;be&nbsp;“the world’s most beautiful twins,” and hundreds of&nbsp;agencies are lined up&nbsp;to&nbsp;sign them as&nbsp;models.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> are mesmerized by&nbsp;the beauty of&nbsp;these stunning twins and we&nbsp;suggest you take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;these gorgeous kids.</p><p>This stunning pair was born in&nbsp;<a href=# title=California data-link=tag>California</a> before their due date and, luckily, they were healthy. Their parents, Kevin and Jaqi Clements named the twins before they were even born. Quoting Jaqi, “They came 4&nbsp;and a&nbsp;half weeks early, but knowing their personalities now it&nbsp;makes total sense that they would show up&nbsp;early, unannounced, and ready to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;anything.”</p><p>As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the twins were born, even the doctors and nurses in&nbsp;the hospital were stunned by&nbsp;their beauty. Things were pretty much the same when they grew&nbsp;up. 6&nbsp;months later, their mother Jaqi introduced her girls to&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;modeling. But then she changed her mind because the Clements had to&nbsp;look after their 2-year-old son Chase, and a&nbsp;new set of&nbsp;twin daughters at&nbsp;home. Adding modeling on&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;that would have made their daily lives much harder.</p><p>But, in&nbsp;2017, Jaqi was ready to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;another shot. Their daughters were growing and developing their own personalities, they also loved to&nbsp;perform their dance routines in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;any audience. So, with her daughters’ consent, she approached some industry contacts and got Ava and Leah signed to&nbsp;2&nbsp;different agencies.</p><p>Jaqi also makes sure that her daughters attend school. If&nbsp;there are any shoots booked via Instagram, she schedules them on&nbsp;weekends or&nbsp;right after school to&nbsp;ensure that the twins don’t miss out on&nbsp;their studies. If&nbsp;the shoots involve an&nbsp;agency, they have a&nbsp;designated teacher on&nbsp;set to&nbsp;help the twins with their school work.</p><p>When the twins have to&nbsp;show up&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;set, they get up&nbsp;early to&nbsp;drive 2&nbsp;hours to&nbsp;Los Angeles because this is&nbsp;where most of&nbsp;their jobs take place. Sometimes, their mother surprises them by&nbsp;planning a&nbsp;lunch, dinner, or&nbsp;fun little outing with their friends in&nbsp;LA. Because shouldn’t life be&nbsp;fun when you’re busy studying and working at&nbsp;such an&nbsp;age?</p><p>In&nbsp;the early days of&nbsp;their modeling career, their mother Jaqi would take photos with her old camera and cell phone. Now she prefers getting them done by&nbsp;professional photographers because they have a&nbsp;knack for developing unique images.</p><p>After all these years, these gorgeous twins have successfully made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;famous brands like Crocs, Sandcastle Magazine, Target, Skechers, Recess Kids, and a&nbsp;lot more. Their undeniable natural beauty stole everyone’s heart in&nbsp;no&nbsp;time.</p><p>Gradually, as&nbsp;the twins got into modeling, they began developing a&nbsp;taste for&nbsp;it. They wanted more and Jaqi wanted to&nbsp;make sure her girls were happy. Now, since the girls are young, and their parents were unsure of&nbsp;what to&nbsp;do, Jaqi got them enrolled in&nbsp;dancing and swimming classes, and let them explore modeling too on&nbsp;their 7th birthday. She considered 7&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;their lucky number since the twins were born on&nbsp;July&nbsp;7.</p><p>This exquisite beauty runs in&nbsp;the entire <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>! Now we&nbsp;know where the twins got their good looks from. You may be&nbsp;surprised to&nbsp;learn that girls’ brother, Chase Robert, is&nbsp;also an&nbsp;aspiring model and loves to&nbsp;play basketball.</p><p>What makes everything worth it&nbsp;for the Clements is&nbsp;they know how to&nbsp;enjoy their experiences. The family goes on&nbsp;adventures every now and then. The girls have surely grown into this lifestyle. They love to&nbsp;dress&nbsp;up, sing, dance, and be&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;attention. Although, Ava and Leah do&nbsp;face some criticism from their audience, they know that their family has their back at&nbsp;all times.</p><p>Have these images managed to&nbsp;melt your heart?
