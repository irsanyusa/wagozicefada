This railroad connected Sacramento, California to Promontory, Utah, playing a crucial role in the development of the American West.</p><p>Hopkins faced significant challenges early in life. After his father's death in 1828, he was forced to leave school and work as a clerk to support his family. Despite this, Hopkins developed a reputation for thriftiness and talent for business which served him well throughout his career.</p><p>In the 1850s, Hopkins became involved in various business ventures in California during the Gold Rush era. He eventually partnered with Collis Huntington to form "Huntington Hopkins and Company" in 1855.</p><p>In 1861, Hopkins joined forces with <a href=#>Leland Stanford</a>, <a href=#>Charles Crocker</a>, and Collis Huntington to establish the Central Pacific Railroad. As the railroad's treasurer, his financial expertise and meticulous nature earned him the nickname "balance-wheel of the Associates" from historian Hubert Howe Bancroft.</p><p>Hopkins married his first cousin, Mary Frances Sherwood, in 1854. The couple had no biological children but adopted Timothy Nolan, the son of their housekeeper. Despite his frugal nature, Hopkins was persuaded by his wife to build a grand mansion on Nob Hill in San Francisco close to those of his fellow founders.</p><p>In his later years, Hopkins suffered from health problems. He passed away while aboard a company train near Yuma, Arizona. His death led to a significant legal battle over his estate between his wife, Mary, and their adopted son, Timothy.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>September 1</a>, <a href=#>1813</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Henderson, New York, USA<br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Virgo</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>March 29</a>, <a href=#>1878</a> (aged 64)<br></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Articles and Photos</h2><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/photos/golden-spike.jpg width=270 height=205 alt="The Golden Spike" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>The Golden Spike</h3><span class=linked_text>The 1st Transcontinental Railroad is finished at last!</span><br><span class=linked_date>May 10, 1869</span></a></li></ul><h2>Business Career</h2><h2>Personal Life</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1854-09-22</a> Future railroad magnate Mark Hopkins Jr. marries Mary Sherwood</li></ul><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Industrialists</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwucCromagn6W4qrrS</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
