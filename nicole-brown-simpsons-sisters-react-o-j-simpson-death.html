Simpson’s death.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The three sisters—Denise Brown, Dominique Brown, and Tanya Brown—sat down with <a href=#>ABC News</a>’ Diane Sawyer, with Denise saying that when she heard about Simpson’s death, she felt “this sense of kind of relief in a way.” The sisters added, however, that they felt for their niece and nephew, Sydney and Justin, who are Simpson and Nicole’s children.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s very complicated,” Dominique told ABC News. “But I have a relationship with the kids that means everything to me, and I was … very, very sad for them.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Simpson <a href=#>died</a> at the age of 76 on April 10, after losing his battle with cancer. His family <a href=#>announced the news on X</a>, asking the public to respect their privacy. Simpson had previously shared his cancer diagnoses in a video posted on X in 2023.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Known as the “Juice,” Simpson was an American football running back who was accused and later acquitted of killing his ex-wife, Nicole, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. June 12 will mark 30 years since the two were stabbed to death in front of Nicole’s Los Angeles home in 1994.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dubbed the “Trial of the Century,” the case <a href=#>captivated</a> Americans from the beginning. While Simpson was acquitted of all criminal charges, he was later found liable for two wrongful-death civil suits brought by the two victims’ families. He maintained his innocence all his life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Brown sisters have since tried to raise awareness about the issue of domestic violence and campaigned to strengthen the <a href=#>Violence Against Women Act</a>, which is a landmark law that aims to prevent domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Nicole Brown Simpson’s Sister: ‘My Heart Still Aches’</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Denise also said she felt like she had said the wrong thing years ago, when Nicole confided in her about a violent incident with Simpson.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I asked her all the ‘whys’ that you don’t ask. … ‘Why don’t you just get out of this relationship? Why don’t you just leave him?’ ” Denise told ABC News. “Those are things that you don’t say, and I didn’t realize that at the time.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I just wish that I had known more,” Dominique said. “I just wonder if I could have done more to help or to listen to her.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Browns said that the grief of losing their sister is still strong, decades later.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The pain doesn’t go away, it doesn’t subside, doesn’t get easier,” Denise said. “But you do the best you can and you move on. And it’s one step forward.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The interview with ABC News comes before a new lifetime documentary, The Life & Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, will air on June 1 and 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWhognGCjqegnKecmnqjvs6wpWarmaK9tLvNrGSsoaOpsrO%2FjKucmpukYrxutoysoKaoo6S7brDEmquhZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
