Read on to find out why her audition brought him to tears.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘American Idol’ Week 3 Auditions</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kimmy Gabriela</h3><p>This 17-year-old grew up in a musical family and has been inspired by her father. For her audition, she performed “Let’s Hurt Tonight” by OneRepublic. Katy Perry then asked her to sing a song in Spanish. The judges predicted she could make it to the Top 10. Unsurprisingly, Kimmy got a golden ticket to Hollywood.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lauren Mascitti</h3><p>This singer brought her fiancé, country singer and songwriter Shawn Camp, to play guitar for her audition. Lauren works as a nurse at Nashville, but aspires to be a musician. She performed an original song. Katy said it was “moving,” and Luke Bryan compared her to last season’s contestant Laci Kaye Booth.

She performed “Rise Up” by Andra Day. The judges were impressed by her voice, calling her the best they’ve seen all day. In what Katy called a “magical moment,” they sent her to Hollywood.

However, his great-grandmother, a Lionel Richie superfan, upstaged him when she showed up. She and Lionel danced together as he serenaded her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Dillon James</h3><p>This tattooed singer has struggled with drugs and alcohol, as well as homelessness. He’s been sober for two years, and now he’s pursuing his passion for music. He performed “Make You Feel My Love” by Bob Dylan. Luke said his voice wasn’t what he expected, and Katy called him “mysterious.” They sent him to Hollywood.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Geena Fontanella</h3><p>Geena is a Katy Perry superfan who performed an original song for her audition.
