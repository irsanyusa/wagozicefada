Although its sense of Scottish geography is slightly off as once across the bridge the hero finds himself in the middle of the Highlands!</p><h2>Whisky Galore (1949)</h2><p>Based on the true story of a wartime ship packed with 50,000 cases of whisky that ran aground off the Outer Hebrides, Alexander Mackendrick's directorial debut is as funny today as it was over half-a-century ago. The real ship - the SS Politician - ran aground off Eriskay and it is said that one of the estimated 250,000 bottles of her whisky is still found by someone on the beach every other year.</p><h2>Brigadoon (1954)</h2><p>Gene Kelly becomes enchanted by a mythical village in the Highlands in this classic musical. The village was indeed mythical, the whole film was shot on a soundstage in Los Angeles.</p><h2>The Wicker Man (1974)</h2><p>Edward Woodward stars as a policeman sent to investigate strange happenings on the remote Scottish island of Summerisle. A strange, disturbing film that was largely ignored upon its release The Wicker Man has become one of the great cult classics of modern cinema.</p><h2>Just Another Saturday (1975)</h2><p>A stark, brutal look at sectarian violence and a grim snapshot of the No Mean City Glasgow of the early 1970s, this film is not easy viewing, but it's well worth it. Not least for a revelatory performance by the young Billy Connolly as Paddy - Connolly's first serious acting role.</p><h2>That Sinking Feeling (1979)</h2><p>Scottish uber-director Bill Forsyth's debut feature tells the story of a bunch of likely lads planning the biggest ever heist . . . of a toilet factory! A beautiful gentle comedy from the late 1970s.</p><h2>Gregory's Girl (1981)</h2><p>Over twenty-five years on and Bill Forsyth's Cumbernauld-shot masterpiece still looks as fresh as a summer morning. As sweet a take on teenage romance as was ever filmed it's worth watching simply for Chic Murray's show-stealing performance as a pastry-loving headmaster. A joy forever.</p><h2>Local Hero (1983)</h2><p>Forsyth's run of form continued with this (slight) remake of Whisky Galore. A Texas oilman comes to a remote part of Scotland and finds the natives are wilier than he bargained for. Beautifully shot by Oscar-winning cinematographer Chris Menges - Scotland's beaches have never looked better.</p><h2>Comfort and Joy (1984)</h2><p>A great performance by Bill Paterson as Alan Bird - a Glasgow Radio DJ suffering a mid-life crisis - lifts this film out of the ordinary, but the real star of the show is the city itself: from dusk shots of the M8 motorway to Christmas shopping on Buchanan Street, Glasgow sparkles. Oh, and there's a show-stealing cameo from the late, great Rikki Fulton as Paterson's long-suffering boss.</p><h2>Restless Natives (1985)</h2><p>A little-known gem from the mid 80s tells the charming story of two Edinburgh lads who take to robbing coach loads of tourists, accidentally becoming modern-day Robin Hoods in the process. With a stirring soundtrack by Big Country.</p><h2>Highlander (1986)</h2><p>A soundtrack by Queen, a top-drawer cameo by Sir Sean Connery and some incredible Highland scenery all add up to raise this above the level of unashamed top-drawer escapist entertainment. Even the dated 1980's special effects don't seem to matter too much now!</p><h2>Soft Top Hard Shoulder (1992)</h2><p>Long before The Thick of It made him a star of the small screen, Peter Capaldi wrote and starred in this touching story of a young man trying to drive from London to Glasgow to claim an inheritance. Filmed on location in Strathclyde and featuring a terrific cameo from Richard 'Victor Meldrew' Wilson this is well worth tracking down.</p><h2>Shallow Grave (1994)</h2><p>Three friends, one corpse and a suitcase full of money. The best advertisement for Edinburgh property ever made (and the worst for flat-sharing) Shallow Grave introduced the world to the talents of director Danny Boyle.</p><h2>Braveheart (1995)</h2><p>Altogether now - 'FREEEDOM!'. Mel Gibson steps behind the camera to direct and achieves an unlikely feat: a Hollywood film, directed by an Australian and shot largely in Ireland which managed to become the biggest film in Scottish box-office history! It also inspired a generation of football fans to get creative with the face-paint.</p><h2>Rob Roy (1995)</h2><p>Rob Roy failed to achieve quite the same level of commercial success, but the film has much to recommend it: the lochs and glens of Scotland have rarely looked more beautiful and the central performances by Liam Neeson, Tim Roth and Brian Cox are simply towering.</p><h2>Trainspotting (1996)</h2><p>Based on Irvine Welsh's novel, Trainspotting defined the nineties and kick-started the careers of Robert Carlyle, Kelly Macdonald, Ewan McGregor, Euan Bremner and Johnny Lee Miller. The most adrenaline-fuelled look at addiction ever filmed.</p><h2>Mrs Brown (1997)</h2><p>John Madden directed this touching, understated look at Queen Victoria's platonic relationship with her Highland ghillie John Brown. Billy Connolly played Brown and won worldwide critical acclaim for his performance.</p><h2>Ratcatcher (1999)</h2><p>Written and directed by Lynne Ramsay, Ratcatcher is a haunting story of childhood set in the Glasgow of 1973. With garbage strikes, fetid canals and tower blocks forming much of the backdrop it is a tribute to the power of Ramsay's filmmaking that there is not a depressing second in this stunning, unsettling film.</p><h2>Sweet Sixteen (2002)</h2><p>Made by award-winning Ken Loach and set in Greenock this is a tough yet tender look at a young boy's attempts to provide a better life for his mother. It features an incredible performance by 15-year-old Martin Compston, an unknown actor at the time.</p><h2>Red Road (2006)</h2><p>Andrea Arnold's directorial debut swept the board at many film festivals last year and is compelling viewing. It tells the story of a young woman whose job involves watching CCTV monitor footage of a run down estate on Glasgow's Red Road and features a powerful central performance by Kate Dickie.</p><h2>The Illusionist (2010)</h2><p>A French illusionist finds himself out of work and travels to Scotland, where he meets a young woman. Their ensuing adventure changes both their lives forever.</p><h2>Neds (2010)</h2><p>Peter Mullan's third feature as a writer and director, after Orphans and The Magdalene Sisters, returns him to the 1970's Glasgow of his youth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjqKlrKiZp661tc6nZqCqlZbBbr%2FCqKutoaOdeq671aKcrA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
