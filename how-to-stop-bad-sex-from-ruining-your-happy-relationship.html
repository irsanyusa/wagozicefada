Better put, a lack of it or a poor quality of it.</p><p>And here is why that could be a problem. Sex in a relationship is felt more when it’s inadequate than when it’s being done right. When all is going well in the relationship and sex is lit and all that, it contributes to the happiness between partners, but usually not in a grand way. It’s just there as one of the things you love about the relationship.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Take out the sex however, and it leaves gaping hole and a source of concern for one or both partners.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-c9483ca2-0210-4a0f-9df3-ac5d24793891 data-caption="If you are happy, stay so.

However, when sex isn’t going well, it registers a negative impact of up to 70 percent on the experience for the individuals,” explains Toronto-based sex therapist Marion Goertz.</p><p>When your relationship thrives in many other aspects and suffers when it comes to sex and one or both partners are left in a dilemma. In such situation, you wonder if it’s worth it to stay in the relationship. You also wonder if you would be overreacting to walk away.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But experts advise that you shouldn’t think of a stale sex life as the end of the relationship. See it instead as a signal alerting you to the fact that a relationship tune-up is needed. “It’s like the engine warning light that a relationship is needing attention.”</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-3b250e7c-fb73-4938-9423-37c7edf1aa1d data-caption="You may also need to be a little patient with your partner while they get their act together.

You should never be too shy to <a href=# id=e16ae0d9-7c85-4ba9-ae20-fcfbbbb3633e>talk about sex</a> if you intend for it to get better.</p><p>Also, be patient enough to see the changes materialize.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But ultimately, it could be a fundamental issue of <a href=# id=f689f917-94ba-4c84-b9ae-43ab943cae1b>sexual compatibility</a> which may never end unless relationship ends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7x6iuZqyfYsC1u89mmZqcXaiyuXnFq6amZaKqtq%2B1zaBksqelp3qprc%2BpsGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBkfaS6mG5tbg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
