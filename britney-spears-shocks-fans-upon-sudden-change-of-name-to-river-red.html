She also got her fans intrigued about her new tattoo which was assumed to be about her ex Justin Timberlake.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-britney-spears-claims-that-she-changed-her-name-to-river-red>Britney Spears Claims that She Changed Her Name to River Red</h2><p>Days ago, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spears</a> surprised her fans when she unexpectedly switched her name to River Red. The pop icon took to Instagram to announce the shocking news while showing a photo of planet Mars.</p><p>“A bright one … easy does it !!! Thank you, childhood friend, I found my ball … don’t underestimate the power of purity !!!” she wrote. “I see right through it all … it has liquid and is wet … it’s playful and has mass !!! I changed my name to River Red !!! Yet the fire is where it illuminates … to stare at it and jump right in with no fear at all !!!! S***. Now I have to find my FORK !!!”</p><p>To further prove a point, Spears changed her Instagram username to River Red. Such unexpected move alarmed the fans, prompting them to express their concern over the same.</p><p>“River red ?? Britney honey what’s going on,” one fan wrote.</p><p>Subsequently, the “Sometimes” singer posted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>several photos and video clips</a> of herself wearing a bright red bandeau with a Coca Cola logo and a matching mini skirt. At the moment, there is no clear meaning why Spears decided to change her name. Some fans guess though that it might be her new era.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Says Her New Tattoo is Not About Justin Timberlake</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spears</a> also sparked rumors after she showed her latest tattoo of a love heart on her arm. Apparently, the “Criminal” singer revealed her newest ink at a similar time with her now-deleted post about Timberlake. Soon after knowing about this, fans have speculated the connection of the two.</p><p>However, the pop musician eventually clarified the misunderstanding, sharing a short message on her Instagram stories.</p><p>“Just to clarify… my tattoo had nothing to do with an ex in the past !!!” she wrote. “I simply did it because I wanted to !!! The pic with my ex is a time where there was less confusion on what it meant to be together … it is what it is !!!”</p><p>The deleted post consisted of a number of throwback pictures of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spears</a> and Timberlake who she dated between 1999 and 2002. Subsequently, the singer shared a lip of her getting a tattoo in Hawaii. According to her, this is something she now regrets.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_RobertFinley_Trae-PattonNBC-1-220x147.jpg alt="Singer Robert Finley Wows with Original Song in ‘AGT: All-Stars’ Early Release" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>britney spears</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>justin timberlake</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waugraaVrnq0vMSaqaxlo528pLfSZp2apqNiwrG7zWaqrpyUmrtur8eapaCdXaSzbrrAppxmrJ9iv6rCxKtkq52UZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
