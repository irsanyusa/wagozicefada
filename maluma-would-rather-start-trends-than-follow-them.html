For instance, he has a favorite item (boots) and a favorite brand (Yves Saint Laurent). He also has a personal style icon: Michael Jackson.</p><p>"I love Michael Jackson's style," he says. "It's unique. He's also very unique. I believe he always did what he wanted to do with his style to create trends. He was a genius in all of that. I'm sure that all of his ideas for his wardrobe/costumes and concerts were his own."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Outside of plotting his unique sense of style and influences, Maluma also <a href=# id=f59d0254-1f0c-313b-aa15-c7d5b6a4ab3e>finds a number of ways to keep healthy and keep active</a> . He meditates every day, and loves to do yoga, while also finding his time to do all different kinds of workouts (he was a soccer player in his youth, which he credits for his ability to stay disciplined and keep up his pace).</p><p>But for as outgoing and fearless as Maluma might seem, there's still one thing he says he'd never wear: a thong. "I would never wear that. I mean, I love wearing crazy stuff, you know? But that kind of shit, I would never wear."</p><p>And even with all he's already accomplished at the ripe age of 26 (his birthday was just a few weeks ago, in January), he's aiming for his 2020 to be even bigger. He embarked on his world tour last Friday with the first stop in Dubai; he'll also be making stops in Paris, London, Poland, Greece, Milan, and Dubai. He's also hard at work in the studio working on his new album, a follow-up to last year's smash hit 11:11.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-6ce97e44-0fab-4e7e-b825-9caec689d0d0 data-caption='Buy Malumas Look: a href="https://www.bensherman.com/collections/mens-polo-shirts/products/59356-25-textured-stripe-zip-through-polo-dark-navy" target="_blank"Ben Sherman knit polo/a; a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eyeglasses-Starck-eyes-0002Q-BLACK/dp/B07T5RKJ1P" target="_blank"Starck Eyes sunglasses/a'><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/Lr0ktktTURBXy81ZTMxOWVmNy02YmM0LTRmZWItOThjMi1lMjBlODhhODAyYjUucG5nkZUCzQMWzQShwsM></span><p>Plus, there's the thing that everyone always wants to be involved with when they're growing their profilethe silver screen. If someone like Nick Jonas, Usher, or Justin Timberlake can do it, why not Maluma? With his music career already blown up in a major way, it was an opportunity to increase his reach and further explore the media sphere, while expanding to another art form. Why movies? Well, there's a simple answer: "Because I love it too," he says.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-bd512e13-898d-4fb0-84a3-c14dcff00bfe data-caption='Buy Malumas Look: a href="https://www.calvinklein.us/en/mens-clothing/mens-undershirt-tank/cotton-classic-fit-3-pack-ribbed-tank-top-62069070" target="_blank"Calvin Klein Underwear tank top/a; a href="https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=864161032&pcid=999#pdp-page-content" target="_blank"Old Navy pants/a; a href="https://www.santonishoes.com/it/mocassino-in-suede-12103.html" target="_blank"Santoni suede loafers/a; a href="https://www.persol.com/usa/0PO3226S--96-56" target="_blank"Persol sunglasses /a'><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/ut0ktktTURBXy83YmY3MDk0MS05NGU5LTQzODYtOWUzMy1kYzAxNzhkNmM1YmMucG5nkZUCzQMWzQShwsM></span><p>The movie is called Marry Me, and it's centered on a pop star who finds a random fan (a math teacher) in the audience of one of her shows. Those two are played by a couple people you may have heard of before: Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson. Maluma, meanwhile, plays J. Lo's pre-Wilson love interest.</p><p>I was like a young student every day when I went to the movie setI just wanted to learn and have a great time, he says of the movie; he will also join with Lopez to make up original music for the soundtrack. [Lopez and Wilson] helped me out a lot. They were like my parents over there.</p><p>With his music already dominating the charts, the Movie mountain will be the next mountain for this burgeoning superstar to climb. And granted how fast he made his way to the last peak, we wouldn't bet against this next ascension either.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cLnApaymmV2svLa4w2apmqyYmr9uv9Oaqa1lpKeyr7DSZquhmZ5is7C4y6iuZqyYmrpws5Ryp5yknA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
