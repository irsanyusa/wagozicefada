The male celebs in&nbsp;our article are not afraid to&nbsp;speak up&nbsp;about these and other issues they have.</p><p><h2>1. Sam Claflin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bba/258/21b70951259777876d0e68201f.jpg><p>Actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sam Claflin</a> may have been lucky in&nbsp;the genetic lottery, but he&nbsp;still struggles with insecurities about his appearance. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his interviews, he&nbsp;recounted a&nbsp;few incidents where he&nbsp;was pressured to&nbsp;lose weight and felt objectified on&nbsp;set: “I&nbsp;remember doing one job when they literally made me&nbsp;pull my&nbsp;shirt up&nbsp;and were grabbing my&nbsp;fat and going, ’You need to&nbsp;lose a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;weight.’”</p><p>While he&nbsp;recognizes that his experiences are not comparable to&nbsp;those of&nbsp;women, Claflin admits to&nbsp;feeling nervous and insecure when he&nbsp;is&nbsp;required to&nbsp;appear shirtless in&nbsp;a&nbsp;role, explaining, “I&nbsp;get really worked up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the point where&nbsp;I spend hours and hours in&nbsp;the gym and not eating for weeks to&nbsp;achieve what&nbsp;I think they’re going for.”</p><p><h2>2. Channing Tatum</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ec6/db1/29d5a85169a79847d216e5c249.jpg><p>The actor <a href=#>Channing Tatum</a> has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that achieving the perfect body for on-screen roles is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fleeting accomplishment. He&nbsp;also admitted that getting naked in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;crowd was stressful, sharing, “You gotta get naked. [I&nbsp;get] nervous getting naked in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;one person, much less a&nbsp;thousand people, so&nbsp;it’s nerve-racking...all of&nbsp;it.”</p><p>He&nbsp;recognizes that <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> places unattainable pressure on&nbsp;celebrities to&nbsp;fit into certain body types, and he&nbsp;also fell victim to&nbsp;unhealthy habits when filming <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Magic Mike XXL</i></a>. However, the actor acknowledges that men in&nbsp;Hollywood are often able to&nbsp;fit into any role they desire, whereas women face pressure to&nbsp;conform to&nbsp;specific body types.</p><p><h2>3. Richard Madden</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e14/ed8/42eac55a9d9b01df3c4d70819e.jpg><p>The actor, known for his roles in&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Game of&nbsp;Thrones</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Bodyguard</i></a>, has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>faced</a> pressure to&nbsp;lose weight and tone up&nbsp;for numerous jobs throughout his career. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2019&nbsp;interview, he&nbsp;described how people would pinch his “fat rolls” and make him wear corset-like costumes. He&nbsp;also acknowledged the unhealthy and unrealistic expectations placed on&nbsp;actors and how he&nbsp;and his fellow actors would often engage in&nbsp;extreme diets and exercise regimens to&nbsp;meet these demands.</p><p>“I&nbsp;find myself with actor friends&nbsp;— after we’ve done a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;barely eating, working-out-twice-a-day, no-carbing thing for these scenes&nbsp;— looking at&nbsp;each other going, ’We’re just feeding this same stuff that we’re against,’” Madden said.</p><p><h2>4. Chris Pratt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb3/e0d/b43e9e5fd5907e1a49f4915bcf.jpg><p><a href=# title="Chris Pratt" data-link=tag>Chris Pratt</a>, best known for his role as&nbsp;Star-Lord in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Guardians of&nbsp;the Galaxy</i></a> franchise, has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>struggled</a> with body image issues. During a&nbsp;2014 press conference for the film, he&nbsp;acknowledged that he&nbsp;may not fully understand the pressures faced by&nbsp;women in&nbsp;Hollywood, but he&nbsp;could relate to&nbsp;emotional eating and using food to&nbsp;cope with negative feelings.</p><p>“I&nbsp;do know what it&nbsp;feels like to&nbsp;eat emotionally, and...to be&nbsp;sad and make yourself happy with food,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “And then to&nbsp;be&nbsp;almost immediately sad again and now ashamed and then to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;hide those feelings with more food. I&nbsp;know what that’s like. It’s a&nbsp;vicious cycle and it’s a&nbsp;very real thing.”</p><p><h2>5. Ed&nbsp;Sheeran</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d78/369/53c9795e06883dbcfb1eb3ae0f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his interviews, musician Ed&nbsp;Sheeran <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discussed</a> his struggles with body image and how he&nbsp;came to&nbsp;the realization that his unhealthy habits were the cause of&nbsp;his dissatisfaction. He&nbsp;admitted, “I&nbsp;was never really happy with my&nbsp;image and then&nbsp;I realized it&nbsp;was because&nbsp;I was eating fried food every day.”</p><p>However still talking about the body image pressures in&nbsp;the music industry, Sheeran explained that the industry has room for all kinds of&nbsp;people, regardless of&nbsp;their appearance. “There are enough fat people in&nbsp;the industry and there are enough skinny people in&nbsp;the industry and there are enough ginger people in&nbsp;the industry. There’s enough of&nbsp;everyone in&nbsp;the industry, and usually, the ones that aren’t attractive are the ones that do&nbsp;the best.”</p><p><h2>6. Jesse Plemons</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/07a/7de/69388d53f69256e4a8d6bb4730.jpg><p>Everett Collection/East News<span>, </span>Grosby Group/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>GQ</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, Jesse Plemons discussed his weight gain for the film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Black Mass</i></a>. He&nbsp;mentioned how people were shocked by&nbsp;his weight gain, but he&nbsp;had been overweight for a&nbsp;while.</p><p>Talking about it&nbsp;made him more empathetic toward the body image issues women face, as&nbsp;men are not held under the same microscope. Plemons found it&nbsp;strange that people considered his weight gain an&nbsp;accomplishment.</p><p><h2>7. Arnold Schwarzenegger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d86/b92/dae570546ab9bc7ff8c31f05b0.jpg><p>Jack Dempsey/Associated Press/East News<span>, </span>EAST NEWS</p><p>Even bodybuilders are not immune to&nbsp;body image issues, and <a href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that this has stayed with him his entire life. “When I&nbsp;look in&nbsp;the mirror, I&nbsp;throw&nbsp;up,” Schwarzenegger divulged.</p><p>He&nbsp;added that, even when he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the best shape of&nbsp;his life, he&nbsp;was “so&nbsp;critical” of&nbsp;himself because he&nbsp;believed that he&nbsp;was “lacking” something. “I&nbsp;never saw perfection,” said the bodybuilder.</p><p><h2>8. Zayn Malik</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e88/87e/43521a55d7b3e29f40d285e3d6.jpg><p>Former One Direction member Zayn Malik <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> in&nbsp;his 2016&nbsp;book, <i>Zayn</i>, about his struggles with an&nbsp;eating disorder. He&nbsp;revealed that he&nbsp;suffered from the disorder in&nbsp;late 2014, before the band’s final tour, and that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;way for him to&nbsp;feel in&nbsp;control of&nbsp;something in&nbsp;his life.</p><p>Malik said that he&nbsp;would sometimes go&nbsp;for days without eating anything at&nbsp;all and that his weight loss had become so&nbsp;severe that he&nbsp;grew ill. He&nbsp;attributed the disorder to&nbsp;the pressures and stress of&nbsp;being on&nbsp;the road with the band and the impact it&nbsp;had on&nbsp;his eating habits.</p><p><h2>9. Chris Pine</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/187/5a8/5b4f93599f8e06c200aa87c4f5.jpg><p>Jordan Strauss/Invision/East News<span>, </span>Piovanotto Marco/ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p>Actor Chris Pine spoke to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Men’s Journal</i></a><i> </i>about the pressure to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;perfect body in&nbsp;Hollywood. He&nbsp;said that the mass audience only wants to&nbsp;see actors who are physically perfect, with big pecs, great skin, and perfect eyes. Pine believes that this creates body image dysmorphia for young people who don’t see a&nbsp;range of&nbsp;body types represented on-screen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZuucClnGablaGyo7%2BMsJ%2BorpVitLC6xGaroaqfqrSpecGom7JlmajAtrHSZm9qamFmgHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
