Smith found it puzzling that her daughter ended up at a hotel paid for by someone else’s parent. “She was responsible for getting the hotel room for these minors. Her name was on the hotel room for these minors, so I feel like she should be held accountable for my daughter’s death as well,” she told FOX 5.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>In the TikTok video posted before her death, Williams turns to face the door while dancing. She looks startled before the video abruptly ends. Her family is begging authorities to piece together the information that happened in between the video and her death. Smith was not aware that her daughter died until eight hours after she was pronounced dead. Now, she is looking for answers. “What happened after she made that last TikTok video at 12:02 am and she was dead at 12:23 am? I need answers,” Smith said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>SIMON COWELL’S FIRST-EVER TIKTOK DANCE VIDEO IS AMAZINGLY AWKWARD</a></strong></p><p>Kanautica Starkie who was staying at the hotel at the time of Williams’s death spoke out about what she witnessed that day. “I seen two guys coming out the elevator with a little girl holding her.
