Paul Walker’s passing left the world in&nbsp;shock, deeply impacting his fans, the closest friend <a href=# title="Vin Diesel" data-link=tag>Vin Diesel</a>, and above all, his inseparable brother Cody. On&nbsp;the solemn occasion of&nbsp;the 10th anniversary of&nbsp;his departure, Cody has chosen to&nbsp;offer the most heartfelt tribute to&nbsp;Paul, ensuring that his <a href=# title=memory data-link=tag>memory</a> lives on&nbsp;and is&nbsp;never forgotten.</p><p><h2>His lookalike brothers, who never miss a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;honor him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf8/bed/27a1675b178bf98dfd7edf1b27.jpg><p>Paul Walker’s legacy as&nbsp;an&nbsp;iconic figure in&nbsp;<i>The Fast &&nbsp;The Furious</i> franchise is&nbsp;indelible. Renowned for his portrayal of&nbsp;Brian O’Conner, he&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;the first five of&nbsp;six films before his life was cut short. On&nbsp;November&nbsp;30, 2013, at&nbsp;40, Paul was involved in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fatal car accident. At&nbsp;the time, he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the midst of&nbsp;filming <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Fast &&nbsp;Furious&nbsp;7</i></a>, leaving the producers in&nbsp;a&nbsp;quandary as&nbsp;they grappled with how to&nbsp;proceed.</p><p>Luckily, Paul’s younger brothers, Caleb and Cody, came forward to&nbsp;help. They served as&nbsp;body doubles to&nbsp;finish the remaining scenes, ensuring a&nbsp;seamless portrayal that paid tribute to&nbsp;his character and mostly to&nbsp;their late brother. The movie director <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;whole different world for them, and&nbsp;I think they had a&nbsp;newfound respect for what their brother did. I&nbsp;was very grateful to&nbsp;have the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> involved.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a7c/052/18ef185c0b89c58c7aebf0a32f.jpg><p>Paul’s passing had an&nbsp;immense emotional impact on&nbsp;his brothers, Caleb and Cody. However, they remain dedicated to&nbsp;preserving his enduring legacy even years later. While Caleb chose a&nbsp;different path, Cody found solace in&nbsp;following his brother’s acting journey. His involvement in&nbsp;the industry serves a&nbsp;greater purpose—to carry forward Paul’s philanthropic endeavor, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Reach Out WorldWide</i></a> (ROWW), founded in&nbsp;2010.</p><p>“Paul’s legacy was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;good,” Cody <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claimed</a>. “His mission was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good person and help others, and that’s certainly what <i>Reach Out WorldWide</i> continues to&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;this day.” He&nbsp;also added, “His legacy is&nbsp;alive and well.”</p><p><h2>Cody paid a&nbsp;heartfelt and unique tribute to&nbsp;his late brother.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/35e/028/6a48a35afc86811d4ae107e1ee.jpg><p>Since August <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2015</a>, Cody has been joyfully married to&nbsp;his wife, Felicia. Together, Cody and Felicia are blessed with two children, a&nbsp;baby girl, Remi Rogue, followed by&nbsp;the arrival of&nbsp;their son, Colt Knox.</p><p>However, on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>April&nbsp;30</a>, Cody welcomed his latest son. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;deeply touching tribute, Cody Walker named his newborn child a&nbsp;heartfelt homage to&nbsp;his beloved sibling. This poignant gesture comes nearly a&nbsp;decade after Paul’s tragic passing, serving as&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;Cody’s enduring love and admiration for his brother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e25/6e8/2ed09e5f3db145c36036488d44.jpg><p>Cody shares that both he&nbsp;and his brother, Caleb, have completed their respective journeys of&nbsp;expanding their families. Recalling their late brother, Cody reveals the significance behind their decision to&nbsp;carry on&nbsp;his name.</p><p>By&nbsp;choosing to&nbsp;pass on&nbsp;the cherished name to&nbsp;their own children, Cody and Caleb ensure that the essence of&nbsp;their beloved brother lives on&nbsp;through the generations. “My&nbsp;brother, Paul, was Paul William Walker&nbsp;IV, and that name goes back four generations,” says Cody. “Within the family, he&nbsp;went by ‘little Paul’ or ‘Paul 4,’ even though he&nbsp;quickly outgrew our father in&nbsp;height. <strong>It&nbsp;was important to&nbsp;me&nbsp;to&nbsp;have that name carry&nbsp;on</strong>.”</p><p>He&nbsp;further expresses the deep-rooted importance of&nbsp;preserving their brother’s name even after all these years. “This November will mark 10&nbsp;years since we&nbsp;lost my&nbsp;brother, Paul, and&nbsp;<strong>I just felt now was the appropriate time</strong>,” says Cody.</p><p><h2>After nearly 10&nbsp;years, his dear ones still hold his memory close to&nbsp;their hearts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc4/2aa/bbd186561ea96ba90750793d4e.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the 10th anniversary of&nbsp;his passing approaches, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not only his brother who pays tribute to&nbsp;Paul Walker but also the countless individuals who continue to&nbsp;cherish his memory. Recently, a&nbsp;significant event unfolded with the release of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Fast and Furious&nbsp;X</i></a>, where Meadow, Paul Walker’s daughter, made a&nbsp;special cameo appearance.</p><p>Being born into the Fast Family fills her with immense pride, and she considers it&nbsp;a&nbsp;tremendous privilege to&nbsp;honor her father’s enduring legacy through her involvement in&nbsp;the franchise. And as&nbsp;his dearest friend, Vin Diesel, has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “Paul would be&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;her”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc9/d87/ffa9825273976f5b22031b6b3e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;heartfelt tribute to&nbsp;his late friend and co-star, Vin Diesel expressed that Fast X&nbsp;embodies the essence of&nbsp;what Paul envisioned for the franchise. It&nbsp;culminates in&nbsp;their shared passion, commitment, and dedication to&nbsp;delivering thrilling action and heartfelt storytelling.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Vin</a>, this film is&nbsp;a&nbsp;realization of&nbsp;Paul Walker’s dream, and his words offer a&nbsp;poignant reminder that Paul’s presence and impact are still keenly felt within the Fast and Furious universe.</p><p>The <a href=# title=bond data-link=tag>bond</a> between brothers endures beyond life, unbreakable and unwavering. The special friendship between Vin and Paul is&nbsp;no&nbsp;exception. Since Paul’s passing, Vin Diesel has made it&nbsp;his mission to&nbsp;continuously celebrate and honor their <a href=#>friendship</a>, proving its unyielding strength. Their connection remains an&nbsp;eternal testament to&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;true brotherhood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL2iwctmrpqkm5q%2FtHnBq6atoJWneq%2BtzJ6qZqufo3qistOeqWagmaJ6cnyMspyaqqNiwKq6wp5koaGjYsGzrcaimmaokajAqrrGZm9qa2RognA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
