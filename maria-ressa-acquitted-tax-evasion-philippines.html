The ruling represents Ressa’s latest victory against what press freedom advocates have branded as judicial harassment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The four tax evasion charges were filed in 2018 by the government of then-President Rodrigo Duterte, Rappler <a href=# rel=noopener>reported</a>. An official from the clerk’s office of the Court of Tax Appeals, First Division, confirmed Ressa’s acquittal of tax evasion cases to TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ressa, who has been the president and CEO of Rappler since its founding and recently published a book titled <i>How to Stand Up to a Dictator</i>, claims she has been unfairly targeted following the news organization’s reporting of Duterte’s deadly campaign against illegal drugs. Rappler also produces investigative coverage of disinformation online and is one of Meta’s <a href=# rel=noopener>third-party fact-checking partners</a> in the country.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Read More: </b><a href=#><i>The Filipino War on Drugs Killed Thousands. Now the Government Is Blaming Corrupt Police</i></a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Today, facts win, truth wins, justice wins,” an emotional Ressa <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> to reporters outside the Manila court.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ressa, 59, and Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov were the <a href=#>2021 Nobel Peace Prize awardees </a>for their work in journalism amid “increasingly adverse conditions.” In 2018, she was among <a href=#>the “Guardians” of press freedom</a> whom TIME collectively named as “Person of the Year.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Read More:</b> <a href=#><i>‘It Is a Battle for Facts.’ What Nobel Peace Prize Winner Maria Ressa Understands About Why She Was Chosen</i></a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Duterte, a populist and widely popular president, had openly criticized Rappler for its critical coverage of his “war on drugs.” He <a href=# rel=noopener>alleged</a> that it violated foreign ownership laws—which the company denies. In 2018, the Philippines’ Securities and Exchange Commission ordered Rappler to shut down after revoking its operating license, but the news website carried on <a href=#>doing business as usual</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The SEC case was then followed by a string of legal battles. In 2020, a court <a href=#>convicted Ressa of libel</a> and sentenced her to almost seven years in prison. She is out on bail pending her appeal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her acquittal at the tax court on Wednesday leaves only three active legal battles, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to Rappler</a>, including the libel conviction appeal, the SEC case, and a separate tax case.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Hold the Line Coalition—an international group that advocates for press freedom—<a href=# rel=noopener>said in a statement</a> on Wednesday: “We hope we are seeing the beginning of an end to the previous administration’s strategy to instrumentalize the courts as a means to undermine independent news organizations and damage journalists’ credibility. As an immediate next step, we call for all remaining cases against Rappler and Ressa to be closed and their constant persecution to be stopped once and for all.” The group called on the incumbent administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. “to hit reset on his predecessors’ vast campaign of media repression.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Reporters Without Borders’ Press Freedom Index <a href=# rel=noopener>ranks the Philippines</a>, a Southeast Asian nation of 110 million, 147th among 180 in the world, noting that at least 34 journalists have been killed there between 2012 and 2021. As recently as <a href=# rel=noopener>Oct. 3, 2022</a>, a veteran journalist reporting on rampant corruption was shot dead while driving on his way home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamRshnOFjqaYq6GRYr%2Bmv9KaZJqboaq2tcDEnWStmahisret0qKmp2Wgnbattc%2BpoKedo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
