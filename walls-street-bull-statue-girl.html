State Street plans to send a letter to 3,500 companies on Tuesday asking the companies to act.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Business Insider:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>A bunch of men were asked what they think about diversity on corporate boards — the answer won’t surprise you</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">State Street is a huge player in the index fund world, managing about 90% of its assets in passive funds, which are often investing in companies held in the Russell 3000 and FTSE.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The money manager has cited gender diversity as a way to improve company performance and increase shareholder value. The lack of women on boards has long been a problem. Beyond pipeline issues, some boards see no reason to increase their gender diversity, <a href=# rel=noopener>data shows</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Business Insider:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Something is missing from the hedge fund industry</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There has been a lot of discussion on this topic, but the needle hasn’t moved materially,” Lori Heinel, State Street’s deputy global chief investment officer, told Business Insider after the statue’s installment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">State Street wants every company it’s targeting to have at least one female board member and to take steps toward fixing its gender gap, Heinel said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Business Insider:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Schools and businesses across the US will shutter for the ‘Day Without a Woman’ strike</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We’re not going to always automatically vote against the company, but we want to make sure there are tangible, concrete measures they are taking,” Heinel said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For State Street, the statue was a way to draw attention to the problem. Currently, nearly a quarter of boards represented in the Russell 3000 have no women at all, Heinel said, citing Institutional Shareholder Services data.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Business Insider: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Apple, Google, and the 15 other best companies for women</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“One of the most iconic images on Wall Street is the charging bull. So the idea of having a female sort of stand against the bull or stand up to the bull just struck us as a very clever but also creative and engaging way to make that statement,” Heinel said. “Even though it’s a little girl, her stance is one of determination, forwardness, and being willing to challenge and take on the status quo.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Earlier on Tuesday, underneath a light rain, passersby and tourists snapped photos in front of the newcomer. One young man who said he worked in the area described the statue as “cool.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Business Insider: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Companies with women in leadership roles crush the competition</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">State Street installed the statue in collaboration with city officials and expects the statue to stay for up to a month, a company spokesman said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The sculpture was created by artist Kristen Visbal.
