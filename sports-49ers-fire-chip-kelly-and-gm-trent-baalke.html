Baalke had been general manager of the 49ers since 2011, after starting with the team as a scout in 2005. He had two years left on his contract.</p><p>It was reported on Sunday that Kelly would have a chance to talk to the 49ers front office after the game, while Baalke admitted during a radio interview Sunday that he had been fired, though no formal announcement had been made.</p><p>Kelly was unable to revive the 49ers offense this season, as the team averaged just 17.9 points per game, 27th in the NFL. Kelly previously spent three seasons as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, winning ten games each of his first two seasons and going to the playoffs once.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The two moves signal sweeping changes for the 49ers, who have now had three coaches in three years and will be moving onto a fourth after Kelly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70qmmq6yjZMCxu9GtqmZsaZq%2FtHnFoqmeZZOdtrF5yp6jpbFdlrulecamZK2qlaPBbq7AmqOknV9shbu0lGlt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
