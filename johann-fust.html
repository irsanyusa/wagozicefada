He became involved in printing by his financial support of Johann Gutenberg, lending money to Gutenberg to develop the printing press.</p><p>In 1455, however, the pair had a still mysterious disagreement and Fust sued Gutenberg to recover his investment. The court ruled in Fust's favor, and he acquired Gutenberg's printing materials and workshop.</p><p>After the lawsuit, Fust partnered with Peter Schöffer, Gutenberg's former apprentice. Together they published the Psalter of 1457, the first book with a complete date and colored initials. They went on to print other religious and classical texts.</p><p>Fust expanded the market for printed books by setting up a sales branch in Paris. He sold copies of the 42-line Bible in both paper and vellum versions. This early venture into international sales helped spread printed books across Europe.</p><p>During a trip to Paris, Fust was accused of witchcraft due to the rapid production of identical Bibles. He proved he was using printing technology, however, and was released from jail—an incident which demonstrates exactly how revolutionary printing was at the time.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>c. 1400</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Mainz, Germany</p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>October 30</a>, <a href=#>1466</a><br><b>Cause of Death:</b> Suspected plague</p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1455-11-06</a> Lawsuit between Johann Gutenberg and Johann Fust concerning the printing press is decided in favor of Fust, with the Gutenberg's printing press turned over to him</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1457-08-14</a> Johann Fust and Peter Schöffler publish the Mainz Psalter, the first printed book with a complete date</li></ul><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Financiers</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwts6hmKemXZvCtMA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
