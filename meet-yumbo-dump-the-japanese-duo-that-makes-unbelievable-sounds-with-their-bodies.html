Although there is an Asia’s Got Talent, performers like the comedic duo Yumbo Dump have goals that extend well beyond Asia. Get to know the hilarious act that is Yumbo Dump, as they compete on America’s Got Talent All Stars.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-yumbo-dump-creates-sounds-using-their-bodies>Yumbo Dump Creates Sounds Using Their Bodies</h2><p>The comedy duo <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yumbo Dump</a> made a name for themselves due to their unique ability to create sounds using their bodies. Yumbo Dump brought the laughs with their physical humor by using their bodies as props to create very specific noises.</p><p>Yumbo Dump is a comedic duo consisting of Go Kashu as Yumbo, and Daisuke Fujiwara as Dump, both are from Japan. The two of them create noise using their bodies and tools to sound like various things such as owls, dolphins, and UFOs.&nbsp;</p><p>Their comedic stunts, although funny, are certainly not everyone’s cup of tea. Yumbo Dump has been met with controversy in the past, with some viewers vocally disliking their act on social media. Throughout their run in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a> season 13, they are the recipients of several Red Buzzers from the judges who found their act off-putting.</p><p>The duo stays optimistic during their every performance though and prefers to spread happiness however they can. After making it to the Quarterfinals on AGT, Yumbo Dump competed on the German version of the show Das Supertalent in 2019. The same year, they also appeared in Israel’s Got Talent, and more recently in Greece’s Got Talent in 2022.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Heidi Klum Disliked Their Dolphin Love Story Act</h2><p>During the duo’s performance at the Quarterfinals of AGT, they received several Red Buzzers, three in total. Howie Mandel was the only judge that didn’t press his Red Buzzer on Yumbo Dump, and even gave them a standing ovation.</p><p>The same can’t be said about Heidi Klum though, the German model stayed adamant about her decision in their final act of the show. Simon Cowell and Mel B both took back their Red Buzzer votes upon seeing the dolphin love story part of Yumbo Dump’s act. Klum however, chose to keep her vote the way it was, despite the crowd chanting for her to take it back.</p><p>“I really like you guys, and you really make me laugh in the past,” Klum <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>. “But this is the live show, and I feel like you didn’t step it up.”</p><p>Love them or hate them, there’s currently nothing stopping this comedic duo from attaining gold at AGT All Stars. As one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">60 amazing acts</a> that will compete against each other on AGT All Stars, Yumbo Dump will deliver the most hilarious acts the viewers will witness.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_MistressIsabelleBrooks_Santiago-FelipeGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="‘Drag Race’ Fans Allegedly Caused Mistress Isabelle Brooks’s Instagram to Get Suspended" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWpqrqju4ydrKaoXam1pnnJmqeappWosm6w1KhkraCRqXqurcqeqmatnpeyrbXEr5ibpJViwLDBzZ2qZq%2BZqbVuwMeeoKtlkqSxqrHSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
