Some of the messages joked that abusing children was sexually arousing, while others had punchlines directed at specific ethnic or racial groups. One called the hypothetical hanging of a Mexican child 'piñata time.'"</p><p>Rachael Dane, a Harvard representative, told Business Insider that the university did not "comment publicly on the admissions status of individual applicants."</p><p>The students were told in April that their acceptances were rescinded, according to The Crimson.</p><p>The group in question seems to be a spinoff of a more "lighthearted" Facebook group chat for prospective students to share memes, according to The Crimson. To join the "dark" group chat, students reportedly had to "post provocative memes in the larger messaging group."</p><p>"They were like, 'Oh, you have to send a meme to the original group to prove that you could get into the new one,'" Cassandra Luca, an incoming freshman who was part of the first group but not the "dark" group, told The Crimson.
