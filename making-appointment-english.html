Whether you have an urgent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">health concern</a> or just want to arrange a check-up, it’s important that you know how to express your needs and concerns and communicate your ailments or injuries. You need to be well-prepared to arrange an appointment at a time that suits you and the service provider and to reschedule the appointment, if absolutely necessary.</p><p>Here we will prepare you for making appointments in English effectively and getting the best healthcare experience you can.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Starting-the-conversation>Starting the conversation</h2><p>Time to pick up the phone and make the dreaded call! Naturally, it’s best to be as polite as possible to the receptionist, their job is to help you get the care you need after all, so be sure to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">greet them</a> accordingly. Start by giving them your name and stating the reason for your call.</p><p>A good opening line might be: “Hello, this is Joe Scott speaking. I would like to make an appointment to see Dr. Smith, please.”</p><p>Or perhaps: “Good morning. This is Jody Millercalling. I would like to arrange an appointment with one of your dentists, please.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Explaining-what-you-need>Explaining what you need</h2><p>Know when you will be available for an appointment beforehand and be ready to tell the receptionist when you can attend an appointment. For instance: “I have to work during the day on Tuesday and Wednesday. Do you have an appointment available on Thursday or Friday?”</p><p>You may be asked for the nature of your complaint so that you can be referred to the appropriate doctor or dentist. There is no need to go into the details if you don’t wish to or feel that the reason for the appointment is too personal but the following common issues are sure to help you out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Injuries-and-complaints>Injuries and complaints</h2><ul><li>I have not been feeling at all well lately, so I would like to make an appointment to see Dr Bosang, please.</li><li>I have <strong>hurt/injured/cut/bruised/sprained</strong> my finger, leg, arm etc.&nbsp;</li><li>I have a <strong>pain/swelling</strong> in my stomach/chest/neck/back etc.</li><li>My hand/leg/foot/finger etc. is <strong>hurting me.</strong></li><li>I have had a <strong>severe sore throat/headache tummy ache</strong> for four days, so I need to see a doctor urgently, please.

I have <strong>a cavity in my tooth</strong> which is hurting me very badly.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Speaking-with-the-doctor/dentist>Speaking with the doctor/dentist</h2><p>When you attend for your appointment the doctor will ask you about your symptoms or concerns, so it is best to have these well-prepared so that you don’t forget important information. The doctor is trained to be professional and empathetic, so don’t hesitate to tell them the nature of your problem, i.e. that you have been experiencing bouts of pain in your tummy, for instance, or that you have been feeling very low recently. Be honest and straightforward as doctors have heard it all and they just want to help you get better.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversation with the doctor could go as follows:</p><p>Doctor: What can I help you with today, Joe?&nbsp;</p><p>Joe:&nbsp;I have been having <strong>severe pain</strong> in my stomach, doctor.</p><p>Doctor: How long have you been experiencing these <strong>symptoms</strong> for?&nbsp;</p><p>Joe:&nbsp; It has been going on for about four days and I get <strong>cramps</strong> several times a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Doctor:&nbsp; Oh dear! What part of your <strong>abdomen</strong> are you getting the cramps in?</p><p>Joe:&nbsp; At first it was in the middle but now it is low down on the right-hand side.</p><p>Doctor:&nbsp; Have you been able to eat and drink or have you been sick?</p><p>Joe:&nbsp; My <strong>appetite</strong> has not been good at all and I do experience some <strong>nausea</strong> most days. I was not able to sleep at all last night with the pain, even though I took <strong>painkillers</strong>.</p><p>Doctor:&nbsp; I’m sorry to hear that, Joe. I will need to <strong>examine</strong> your abdomen. Can you lie down on the couch over here please, so that I can check your abdomen to see where it is tender?&nbsp; Does it hurt when I press here?</p><p>Joe: Yes, that hurts a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>Doctor:&nbsp; I will check the other side.&nbsp; Does it hurt on this side?</p><p>Joe:&nbsp; No, that side is fine.</p><p>Doctor: In order to make a diagnosis I will need to send you for an <strong>x-ray</strong>, Joe! Take this<strong> referral letter </strong>to the<strong> Radiology Department </strong>at the<strong> </strong>hospital<strong>. </strong>Don’t worry. The x-ray will determine<strong> </strong>what<strong> </strong>treatment<strong> </strong>you will need.</p><p>Joe: Do you think I will need an <strong>operation</strong>?</p><p>Doctor:&nbsp; I hope not Joe, but we have to be certain.&nbsp;</p><p>Joe:&nbsp; Thank you, doctor.&nbsp;</p><p>Doctor: You’re very welcome Joe. Be sure to bring your<strong> health insurance</strong> details with you.&nbsp; Best of luck, Joe.&nbsp; We will be in touch with you later in the day when we hear from the hospital with the diagnosis.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Canceling,-postponing-or-rearranging-an-appointment>Canceling, postponing or rearranging an appointment</h2><p>Once you know how to make an appointment with a doctor in English, you may also need to know how to change your appointment <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">time and/or date</a> if something urgent comes up. Phone the doctor’s or dentist’s surgery as soon as possible, so that the receptionist may be able to offer the appointment to someone else. The conversation might go as follows:</p><p>Receptionist:&nbsp;Hello, how can I help you?</p><p>Jody:&nbsp;My name is Jody Miller.&nbsp; I have an appointment with Dentist Rodgers for Friday at 3.30 pm. Unfortunately, I cannot attend. I’m sorry for the inconvenience. Would it be possible to rearrange the appointment for next week, please?</p><p>Receptionist:&nbsp;That is no problem, thank you for letting us know in good time. Let me check Dr. Rodger’s schedule for next week. You are in luck, she has a cancellation on Tuesday morning at 10.30 am. Will you be able to attend at that time?</p><p>Jody:&nbsp;Yes, thank you. That would be perfect.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Medical matters and beyond</h2><p>Hopefully, you now have the information you’re going to need on how to schedule an appointment in English with a healthcare professional! This will help you in other areas of life as well because arranging and keeping appointments are key skills in the workplace and in personal relationships too.
