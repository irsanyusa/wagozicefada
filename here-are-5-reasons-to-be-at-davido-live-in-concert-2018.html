Everytime Davido steps up to the stage, there’s always a treaty in the offing for the fans. And so we don’t need a public announcement to know there’s already a grand plan being hatched by the OBO himself.</p><p>While we strongly believe that millionaires will be made tonight going by OBO’s mantra to lift others, some are of the opinion that it is the chef Chi who will finally be making her debut on stage but others say he will be unveiling a newly signed act tonight. Whatever the case, we&nbsp;sha&nbsp;can’t wait to find out.</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davido will be giving Lagos a taste of London</strong></p><p>Davido has said that if you won’t be able to make his 02 Arena concert in London, then you dare not miss the Eko Atlantic show in Lagos.</p><p>With so much planning going underway for the London installment of the Davido ‘live on stage’ series, OBO is gifting his fans from the grassroots, an experience worth treasuring by revealing peeks of what London has waited several months to behold.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;Plenty&nbsp;Hits</strong></p><p>Davido has promised to hold Lagos to a standstill as he unleashes upon his fans, his discography of music hits from Dami Duro, to Gobe, Skelewu, The Money, Gbagbe Oshi, IF, FIA, Assurance, Nwa Baby and the latest Wonder Woman, in an unravelling, never-before-seen show.</p><p><strong>4.&nbsp;The DMW squad</strong></p><p>Members of the DMW dominated the charts this year with multiple music singles released. At the Davido Live concert, you’re most certainly going to have the complete roll-call of the label artistes delivering bangers like Mind, Aje, Aza, Twisted and many more.</p><p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refreshment</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>His drink sponsors have promised to keep the crowd refreshed and recharged for the night with servings of your favorite drinks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mrKyhk2S1pr7EZpirnV1qerOxwKymp6tdqbxursRmmK1llJbDqrDOZqOirpVitq95wqilnJ2iqXpzfJBxZp2xkq27uX8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
