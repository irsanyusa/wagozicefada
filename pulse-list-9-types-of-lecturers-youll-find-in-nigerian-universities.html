The respected ones</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Every university has a lecturer who commands so much respect from students and lecturers alike. No one messes with this type of lecturers, not because they are elderly, but probably because of the status they have attained in academia. Whenever these lecturers are lecturing, the class is always well organized and quiet.</p><p>2. The Parent-like lecturers</p><p>These lecturers apart from being diligent in shaping the future of their students, they also make effort to advise them on taking the right steps and making the right decision in life.</p><p>Their class is usually half lecture half advice. This type of lecturer see their students as their own children and&nbsp; always remind them about the efforts their parents are making to send them to school and why they should not disappoint them.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>3. The sadist</p><p>The lecturers you find in this category are always unfriendly, unimpressed and unapproachable. Their class is always boring and no matter how hard you try, <a href=# id=058c9f95-2872-5199-8955-62419cd38e50>you can't impress them</a>. They are the ones that believe A is for God, B for lecturers while the students grades start from C. Students' failure seems to be their success.</p><p>4. The lazy lecturer</p><p>These ones disappear after giving you the course outlines for a semester. They only come to class twice or three times before examinations begin. And whenever they come to class, they don't really care if you understand their teaching or not. Coming to class is only for fulfilment of righteousness.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>5. The randy lecturer</p><p>6. The Bookseller</p><p>This is a lecturer cum bookseller who goes to class only to lecture for some minutes and spend the rest of his class to advertise his handouts. This lecturer makes his book compulsory on every student and failure to buy his book could earn you a zero for CA because his book is automatically your continuous assessment. The Head of Class&nbsp; (HOC) is usually the best friend of this type of lecturers.</p><p>7. The student-lecturer</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>These are also known as assistant lecturers who start their teaching career by serving as errand boy for the senior lecturers in their department. their job roles in the department include helping lecturers to mark scripts, invigilate during during tests and exams and also help the lecturer to whom they are attached with some of their lectures.</p><p>8. The funny ones</p><p>You will never be wrong if you call these types of lectures comedians. Lecturers in this category find the most hilarious analogies to explain concepts. Students easily connect with them because of their friendliness and sense of humour.</p><p>Expectedly, there is never a dull moment in funny lecturers' class. Their style and approach to teaching break down seemingly difficult concepts, thus, creating a happy atmosphere that helps students to learn better.</p><p>9. The religious ones</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Every faculty has that religious man or woman as a member of staff. The religious lecturers are those students adjudged to be righteous men who'll not engage associate themselves with bribery or sex scandal on campus because of their religious beliefs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwv9Oum56mpGS9trjSnmSloaOpenp507KnnqtdpLNuuMScq66qlafAbsXOrqOlZZaeu6V5yKdkp6GXmr%2Bqrc1mrKehppq%2FtLXTopysZ2CdfXmwzaM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
