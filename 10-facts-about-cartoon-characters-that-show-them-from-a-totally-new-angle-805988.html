We&nbsp;use quotes from them and remember all the iconic moments, but we&nbsp;still don’t know a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;interesting stories behind the characters of&nbsp;these cartoons. For example, <i>Lady and the Tramp</i> almost didn’t have the spaghetti noodle kiss in&nbsp;that famous dinner scene.</p><p>The <strong>Bright Side</strong> team decided to&nbsp;learn more about our favorite <a href=# title="cartoon characters" data-link=tag>cartoon characters</a> and wants to&nbsp;tell you some unexpected facts about them.</p><p><h2>Shrek was originally red-nosed, had no&nbsp;teeth, and lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dump.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f9b/07b/2ae6cf51e4935bdf6088606b7d.png><p>In&nbsp;the early drafts, Shrek was very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>different</a> from the Shrek we&nbsp;know. He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;red nose, no&nbsp;teeth, he&nbsp;wore sandals, and looked much goofier. In&nbsp;the book the animation was based&nbsp;on, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> fire-breathing.</p><p>Also, he&nbsp;didn’t live in&nbsp;the swamp right away. He&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dump near a&nbsp;village. But these ideas didn’t work with the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lonely and misunderstood character. So&nbsp;the creators decided to&nbsp;put him near a&nbsp;swamp.</p><p><h2>The Beast became one because he&nbsp;didn’t love a&nbsp;fairy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8fb/5f1/7925cc5a0993c9c13aa7d0abc0.jpg><p>The oldest version of&nbsp;<i>Beauty and the Beast</i> was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>different</a> from the Disney cartoon. The prince lost his father when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;child, so&nbsp;his mother had to&nbsp;rule the kingdom and left him in&nbsp;the care of&nbsp;an&nbsp;evil fairy. So&nbsp;the fairy turned the prince into a&nbsp;beast because he&nbsp;didn’t love her.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;character from <i>Little Women</i> was the inspiration for Belle.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ea/c0a/b392ac557cab816d3fa2c08fec.jpg><p>The first movie adaptation of&nbsp;Louisa May Alcott’s <i>Little Women</i> that was released in&nbsp;1933 was the inspiration for the creators of&nbsp;<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i> Belle’s independent temper was partially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>based</a> on&nbsp;Jo&nbsp;March.</p><p>Jo&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> the smartest one among her sisters, she loved reading and writing, and she didn’t like the idea of&nbsp;marriage. In&nbsp;the modern version (2019), Saoirse Ronan portrayed her.</p><p><h2>Jackie Chan was the voice of&nbsp;the Chinese version of&nbsp;<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a8/5d3/f4d6525e7aa441478b118704fd.jpg><p>In&nbsp;China, Beast from <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spoke</a> in&nbsp;the voice of&nbsp;Jackie Chan. The actor also needed the music education he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>received</a> at&nbsp;opera school. Aside from voicing one of&nbsp;the characters, he&nbsp;also sang some of&nbsp;the song, including the most famous one, “Beauty and the Beast” by&nbsp;Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson in&nbsp;the original version.</p><p><h2>Scar from <i>The Lion King </i>was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;baboon.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f48/f6c/61d82d5787b8bd5e30985dcb88.jpg><p>The original version of&nbsp;<i>The Lion King</i> was very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>different</a> from what we&nbsp;saw. The story was centered around the competition between lions and baboons. Scar was still an&nbsp;antagonist, but a&nbsp;baboon. Rafiki was a&nbsp;cheetah. Simba would also not leave the kingdom but, instead, would become a&nbsp;“lazy, slovenly, horrible character” due to&nbsp;manipulations from Scar, so&nbsp;Simba could be&nbsp;overthrown after coming of&nbsp;age.</p><p><h2>The fairies from <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> are based on&nbsp;elderly women.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/164/c95/8444895b3e9e786f7cd439d5aa.png><p>The creators of&nbsp;the cartoon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>watched</a> elderly ladies at&nbsp;wedding receptions and in&nbsp;grocery stores. They noticed some key features in&nbsp;their behavior: many women wore hats and walked fast, no&nbsp;matter where they went. This was what the 3&nbsp;good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, were based&nbsp;on.</p><p><h2>Diego wasn’t supposed to&nbsp;survive at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;<i>Ice Age</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b7d/8c8/0e1faa5167badf5506302d0414.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the first <i>Ice Age</i>, there was a&nbsp;scene where Diego was fighting other saber-toothed tigers. He&nbsp;was wounded, and other characters lost hope he&nbsp;would live. But soon, Diego wakes up&nbsp;and catches up&nbsp;with his friends.</p><p>In&nbsp;the first version of&nbsp;the cartoon, Diego actually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>died</a>. But this scene made the kids that watched it&nbsp;cry, so&nbsp;the creators decided to&nbsp;change Diego’s fate, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;the next parts of&nbsp;the franchise.</p><p><h2>Rapunzel’s hair was designed based on&nbsp;art.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/345/e27/3b41465cccbd53ad20199e2be7.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the main goals of&nbsp;the animators was to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;effect that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>looked</a> like oil paintings. They didn’t want any photorealism, they just wanted to&nbsp;make the hair look gorgeous. Jean-Honore Fragonard’s paintings were used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reference to&nbsp;create the hairstyle.</p><p><h2>Elsa’s prototype was Amy Winehouse.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/67a/5c5/dc56f659ff9edc866666025793.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;main characters in&nbsp;<i>Frozen</i> was originally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>inspired</a> by&nbsp;Amy Winehouse&nbsp;— a&nbsp;British singer with a&nbsp;tragic fate. At&nbsp;the early stages of&nbsp;production, Elsa had dark hair and big eyes.</p><p>Artist Claire Keane that worked on&nbsp;this character also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that she imagined her to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;deep, soulful voice and dramatic mood swings. But then the character changed quite a&nbsp;bit. But the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>drama</a> in&nbsp;Elsa’s look and her big eyes remained unchanged.</p><p><h2>The famous spaghetti moment and the kiss between Lady and the Tramp almost didn’t happen.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/599/4f3/b5fc565de1be2a71966357aa7a.jpg><p>This episode today <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>is</a>&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous in&nbsp;the movie industry. But Walt Disney didn’t want this scene to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the cartoon. He&nbsp;wanted the characters to&nbsp;be&nbsp;human-like, and he&nbsp;believed that this kind of&nbsp;behavior in&nbsp;dogs was unbelievable. The animals sharing food <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>couldn’t look elegant</a>. But in&nbsp;the end, Franklin Thomas developed a&nbsp;draft of&nbsp;the scene that eventually persuaded Disney.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you like these cartoon characters?
