She’s amazed the audience many times with her daring outfits and looks, but this time, she’s caught everyone’s attention in&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole new way. Many people were stunned when they saw a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;the actress in&nbsp;her bikini on&nbsp;vacation in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Italy data-link=tag>Italy</a>.</p><p><h2>She admits that this photo will ’haunt’ her for the rest of&nbsp;her life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d1b/974/a091fb506c9b4eece68b702f63.jpg><p>Collin Xavier/Image Press Agency ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;2008, Helen Mirren, at&nbsp;that time 63&nbsp;years old, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stunned</a> the public with her bikini photoshoot. The photo quickly went viral. The Oscar-winning actress became something of&nbsp;a&nbsp;post-mid-life beauty symbol. Reflecting on&nbsp;the photo, Mirren <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>, “I&nbsp;think this thing will haunt me&nbsp;for the rest of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life,” as&nbsp;she was surprised to&nbsp;see this photo in&nbsp;all the major tabloids.</p><p>The actress also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> she was just trying to&nbsp;look good for her husband, Taylor Hackford, “So&nbsp;we&nbsp;were there, swimming a&nbsp;little bit, lying in&nbsp;the sun, and Taylor said, ’Stand up, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;you.’ So&nbsp;I&nbsp;stood up&nbsp;and sucked my&nbsp;tummy in&nbsp;because my&nbsp;husband was taking my&nbsp;photo. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;suck my&nbsp;cheeks&nbsp;in. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;look good.”</p><p><h2>This unexpected fame opened up&nbsp;some business opportunities for her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1d5/f53/1065045afd89ed33237f0f73a6.jpg><p>VALERIE MACON/AFP/East News</p><p>Simon Mirren, Helen’s nephew, said that his aunt received a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;business prospects but showed no&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;capitalizing on&nbsp;this photo. Simon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>, “I&nbsp;begged her to&nbsp;turn&nbsp;us all into millionaires by&nbsp;marketing bikinis after everyone went wild over her fit bikini body but she said absolutely&nbsp;no. She won’t brand herself like that.”</p><p><h2>It’s not the first time an&nbsp;actress has challenged age stereotypes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8bd/347/72432c5d24851af68c9dce2736.jpg><p>The actress unveiled her “radical” hairstyle while promoting her role as&nbsp;Hespera, the villain in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Shazam!

The actress refuted this notion, stating that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;general belief that one should not have long hair after a&nbsp;<a href=#>certain age</a>.</p><p>The Oscar-winning actress hasn’t had long hair since her twenties. She liked the way it&nbsp;looked and decided to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;it. “I&nbsp;thought, do&nbsp;you know what, it’s pretty cool, I&nbsp;think I’ll stick with it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;little while. It&nbsp;will come off eventually...but I’m kind of&nbsp;enjoying&nbsp;it, it’s quite radical,” the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Mirren also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> her pride in&nbsp;representing women over&nbsp;60, stating that creativity, passion, and <a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a> do&nbsp;not stop unless one decides to&nbsp;stop them. “So&nbsp;it’s just self-motivated, really, and never give&nbsp;up. And find <a href=#>enjoyment</a>, if&nbsp;it’s possible in&nbsp;your life,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dda/a56/f139e45b929dadf1ef61a09eaa.jpg><p>ROBYN BECK/AFP/East News</p><p><a href=#>Dame Helen Mirren</a> has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>been vocal</a> about defying <a href=#>beauty standards</a> for older women, citing that her generation has been subject to&nbsp;ageism for too long.
