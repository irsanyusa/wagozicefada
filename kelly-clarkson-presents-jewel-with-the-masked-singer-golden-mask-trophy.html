Not only did Jewel talk about designing her own costume for the show, but Clarkson also presented her with her Golden Mask trophy.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-clarkson-gives-jewel-her-the-masked-singer-trophy>Kelly Clarkson Gives Jewel Her ‘The Masked Singer’ Trophy</h2><p>When asked about the inspiration behind her Queen of Hearts costume, Jewel shared that she does artwork, and she had been drawing a one-eyed heart. “And when I decided to do the show, that’s what I wanted to make it after,” Jewel explained.</p><p>Jewel shared it was really difficult to see out of her costume when she was performing, because the show is so careful to make it impossible for anyone see inside. She called it “really disorienting and discombobulating,” adding that it was “the hardest part” of the experience.</p><p>When Clarkson asked Jewel where she plans to keep her Golden Mask trophy, she replied that she actually hadn’t received it yet. She assumed that it was in the mail, but Clarkson then surprised her by presenting her with the trophy on air. The two of them had fun putting the mask shape up to their eyes. It also perfectly matched Jewel’s gold outfit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>‘THE MASKED SINGER’S QUEEN OF HEARTS, JEWEL, SAYS THE WORLD NEEDS “MORE HEART”</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-singer-is-releasing-a-new-album-next-year>The Singer Is Releasing a New Album Next Year</h2><p>After her victory in Season 6, Jewel did something that no other Masked Singer winner has done before and released an EP of all the song she covered on the show. The collection, titled Queen of Hearts, features Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way,” Edith Piaf’s “La Vie En Rose,” and more.</p><p>Jewel is also planning to release a new album next year called Freewheelin’ Woman. The singer shared that this is “more of a soul record,” explaining, “I’ve never written for my voice. I don’t know why. I’ve always been so into storytelling and lyrics that I never wrote very ambitiously for melodies for some reason.”</p><p>It’s her first studio album since 2015, and the singer revealed that she’s had it finished since before the pandemic started, but has been sitting on it because she initially didn’t want to release it during quarantine. We’re glad she’s finally decided to share it with the world.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/AS609_016A9535-NZ-e1640100205318.jpeg alt="World of Wonder Confirms ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race: UK Versus The World’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdloKeytLHNrapmopWssq151qKroWWknbJuucCsop6cXai2r7PEq2Sgp5yZsq95zJqqpGWkp7yxtNho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
