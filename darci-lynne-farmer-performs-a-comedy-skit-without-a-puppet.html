The talented ventriloquist, singer and actor continually proves she’s one of the best by sharing a variety of different sketches on social media. Although her acts typically involve a puppet, this skit did not.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-darci-lynne-farmer-performs-comedy-skit-with-herself>Darci Lynne Farmer Performs Comedy Skit with Herself</h2><p>The AGT superstar recently tried her hand at a self-conversation in a video recently posted on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>Instagram account</a>. In this case, though, she’s not using her hand while manipulating a puppet’s movements like she usually does.</p><p>“This is horrifying. Watch me have a full-on conversation, with no one.” Farmer said</p><p>She opens the video up with a statement saying that the act she’s about to do is freaking herself out. Farmer admittedly says the conversation she’s about to have is creepy as stated in the caption of her post. She even went as far as to apologize to her viewers in the caption before starting the skit.</p><p>The conversation starts with a joke to the “other person” she’s also voicing. Her ventriloquism abilities have totally improved through time, as no recognizable mouth movement can be seen when she voices the other person.</p><p>It is amusing to watch the AGT winner poke fun at herself while showcasing her talent. Her versatility in entertaining audiences with ventriloquism remains unmatched, being able to do it without a puppet. Her singing skills weren’t showcased in this video, but fans loved it nonetheless.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Darci Lynne’s College Plans?</h2><p>It is admirable for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">world-famous teenager</a> to have been able to balance school with her career as a performer. Living like a real-life Hannah Montana for the past five years, she’s now nearing the end of her high school days. The question that lingers through her mind at the moment is whether or not she’ll go to college.</p><p>As someone who takes their education seriously, this is not an easy decision to make. If she were to enroll at a college, balancing her career and education is no longer an option she could choose. College students have a much more demanding schedule than high schoolers.</p><p>“I want to just slow down a little because next year is my senior year of high school, which is so weird. I’m just taking it step by step.” She said. “I would say next year is going to be the year for me to really explore music and acting, especially after high school for sure. I’m not sure if I’m going to go to college.”</p><p>She remains undecided at the moment but leans towards having a career in music and acting rather than education. She assured the fans that she’ll never abandon ventriloquism completely as it got her where she is today. Ventriloquism will always be in her heart but she plans to explore other areas like music, TV, and film.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_GwenStefani_BlakeShelton_Taylor-HillWireImage.jpg alt="Gwen Stefani Confirms When She and Blake Shelton Started Dating" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qpnKFdocavusRmnZqqnZq%2FbrzEq52oqp2oeqJ5wqiknpypYsCstdNmrqKsmKTCtXnAZqeuqKCawXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
