The AGT: Fantasy League host shared a hilarious story on how he discovered he can’t eat cream cheese ice cream.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-terry-crews-shares-funny-story-about-his-diy-ice-cream>Terry Crews Shares Funny Story About His DIY Ice Cream</h2><p>During his recent appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>, Crews talked about his insane fitness habits. According to the tv personality, he’s not shying away from sweets despite his strict lifestyle.</p><p>At home, Crews used to make ice cream out of cream cheese. However, the recipe had made some intense physiological effects.</p><p>“I had it right before bed and it reacted with me like, when I say I farted all night. I couldn’t stop farting, and it was into the gym morning,” he said. “At 5:00 a.m. I’m still going! My wife was like, ‘No more cream cheese ice cream, man. That is banned in our house.'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>In the conversation, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crews</a> revealed that he built a gym in his house during the pandemic. There, he works out two hours a day, calling it his “peace” and “fortress of solitude.”</p><p>“I’m 55 years old. You don’t have to give it up. That’s what I realized,” he said. “I go to bed at 8:30, but I wake up at 4:30 a.m., 5:00 a.m. to get in that gym and I’m in there doing my thing and I’m already like, I’ve done four hours of great stuff before the day starts.”</p><p>Unlike when he’s young when he could devour three pizzas in one sitting, Crews now has learned how to “treat my body like it’s a prime sports car.” As part of his “weird schedule,” he eats within five-hour window which usually begins at 2:00 p.m. and ends at 8:00 p.m.</p><p>“[During my 40s] I realized, I wasn’t in shape. I was just young,” he said. “Once you get older, you realize, ‘Wait a minute. I have to think about everything I’m putting in my body right now.'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-opens-up-about-being-bald-by-choice>He Opens Up About Being Bald By Choice</h2><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Crews also talked about his bald head. The television host apparently shaves his head every morning as part of his routine. Interestingly, Crews didn’t initially like being bald.</p><p>“Back in 1991, I had the most beautiful flat top you could imagine. [It] was angled, it was beautiful. I got married in it — you could see the pictures, it’s faded up. It’s beautiful. My wife would put a blonde streak in it at times,” he said.</p><p>When he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">joined the NFL</a>, he unfortunately got cut. There, he realized that maintaining his hair would cost him a lot of money. His choice to get bald was further fueled when he saw Michael Jordan.</p><p>“Michael Jordan was coming around and his bald head was sexy and all the thing I said, ‘I’m gonna be like Michael Jordan and I cut my hair off and I just went I’m going all out, I’m shaving it off and I was so disappointed,'” he said. “I didn’t know it was lumpy, I had no idea there was lumps in my head.”</p><p>Admitting he felt bad at first, Crews said he eventually got used to his bald hair. This was especially when people began to appreciate it, telling him he’s like a bulldog.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/JenniferHudson_Common-220x147.jpg alt="Jennifer Hudson, Common Confirm Their Relationship Rumors on ‘The Jennifer Hudson Show’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57056pq7FdmL%2Bmw9JmmpqmlJ6xrcWMmpumoaSoerW0wK1knaGpYraksYycqZ6ZnWK6orDEZp%2BipV2brrPAjK6lnKeeqb%2BwuMuamaWxXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
