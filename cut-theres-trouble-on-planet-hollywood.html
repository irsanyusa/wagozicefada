Gone are its glittering towers of sterno in Chicago, Houston, Miami, Phoenix, Fort Lauderdale, Indianapolis, Maui, Gurnee, Ill., and Costa Mesa, Calif.; the chain will also upgrade several of its 70-plus remaining restaurants worldwide and revamp its menus, according to CEO Robert Earl. (No more Ramburgers?) The chain is digging deep for the extra cash its two largest shareholders and a trust for Earl’s own children have agreed to pony up $30 million to help keep the company going. Right now, thats looking like about as good an investment as a big-budget Kevin Costner directorial effort.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hard truths: Planet Hollywood stock, which sat at $24 shortly after going public in 1997, is now at 19 cents (yes, <i>cents</i>). Founding partners Arnold, Bruce, Demi, Sly and Whoopi arent exactly the hip-kid draws they were at the turn of the decade. And almost any operation that in seven years opens more than 80 restaurants (including ones in Bangkok and Dubai) is bound to have growing pains; PHs latest was a $228 million loss for the quarter that ended in December 1998. Despite Earls rote assertion that “Today is the first step in our plan… for a return to long-term profitability and healthy growth,” this planets orbit is looking mighty wobbly. Once a fresh update of the Hard Rock Caf model, the tourist-trap turf has been invaded by everyone from sports figures (All-Star Caf) to bikers (Harley Davidson Caf) and wrestlers (the WWF restaurant, coming soon to New Yorks legendary Paramount Theater). Does PHs retreat signal the start of the great eater-tainment shakeout? One can only hope.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9wa2tiaIJwr9StZK2glaeytHnTq6aumpyaerC6jKmjmqaVqXqpu8ulsLCnn5l8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
