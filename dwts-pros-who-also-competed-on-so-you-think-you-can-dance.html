One thing most dancers on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> have in common is that they began their television journey out on So You Think You Can Dance. This competition brought professional dancers together to compete for the title of America’s best dancer.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dmitry Chaplin</h2><p>He competed in the second season of So You Think You Can Dance and soon went on to dance professionally in Dancing With the Stars for three seasons. Fun fact, he was supposed to be paired up with Jewel on DWTS season eight, but she had to withdraw from the season due to fractured tibias in both legs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/bp3c0hPYgj/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alan Bersten</h2><p>This current Dancing With the Stars professional was on season 10 of So You Think You Can Dance. He finished in the top 12. He was eliminated after the judges complained about a gap between him and his partner Malece Miller. They were both eliminated due to this.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5UJK4fnM8E/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lindsay Arnold</h2><p>This DWTS mirrorball winner was originally on season nine of So You Think You Can Dance. During her time in the competition she danced a Samba, Paso Doble, Contemporary, and more. Arnold made it into the top eight in the series, then faced elimination during week six of the competition. Luckily, her dancing journey was not over, she was picked perform on Dancing With the Stars in the following year.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bbzxzo2FCyj/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jenna-johnson>Jenna Johnson</h2><p>Jenna Johnson was not the first in her family to audition for So You Think You Can Dance. Previous to her time on the show, her <a href=# class=broken_link>older sisters</a> were cut at the Green Mile. In this episode, judges tell the contestants whether they’ve made it onto the show or not. Jenna outlived her sisters and made it into the top eight of season ten.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BjE2fNYnsV1/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Artem Chigvintsev</h2><p>This professional dancer had to be included considering he placed in the top eight in the first season of So You Think You Can Dance! He came into the show with the main dance style of Latin ballroom but was put to the test with multiple Lyrical dances, a Cha-Cha, Paso Doble, Pop, and more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CIFKGp-g-1T/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Witney Carson</h2><p>Witney Carson auditioned for So You Think You Can Dance in season nine of the competition. During the competition, she performed multiple different types of dances including a Samba, Cha-Cha, Paso Doble, and more. She made it to the Top six/Top three female of the competition before facing elimination. She joined Dancing With the Stars soon after in March 2013.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/v4IG3Ep5U9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Honorable mention:</h2><p>It’s no surprise that DWTS coach Derek Hough is dating someone who is as talented in the ballroom as he is. Hayley Erbert was a mentor on Dancing With the Stars: Juniors in 2018, but otherwise has not been seen on the dance floor without Hough. On her own, she has accomplished a lot in dance after placing in the top six, top three female on season ten of So You Think You Can Dance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CVlYr5wPhs3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Fox-1-1-1.png alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Reveals Season 7 Costumes: The Good, The Bad, The Cuddly" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>so you think you can dance</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7y0edahpmaZnKi8bq%2FOpqeerJWZerC6jKymZrGfqnq1tMinomaxn6p6pK3NZpuappOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
