There, the story goes, Robot ran into a hole created by a fallen tree.</p><p>Ravidat threw some stones into the hole and was surprised that they seemed to travel a long, long way down.</p><p>Returning with some friends and a teacher he climbed down the hole and began to explore. The boys discovered what were to become known famously as the Lascaux cave paintings – estimated to be between 17,000 to 20,000 years old and excitedly described by experts as “the cradle of art”.</p><p>In a cave complex arranged around a main cave about 20 metres long and five metres high were what turned out to be more than 2,000 painted and engraved images of animals and abstract symbols.</p><p>A protective layer of chalk had made the caves watertight enabling the artwork to be remarkably preserved in vibrant blacks, browns, reds, and yellows.</p><p>The paintings are almost all of animals. There is only one human and no flowers, trees or countryside. The meaning of most of the abstract symbols is unknown.</p><p>The cave complex was opened to the public in 1948 and soon attracted about 1,200 visitors a day. And that’s when the problems began.</p><p>By 1955, carbon dioxide from the breath of visitors, along with heat and humidity took their toll on the paintings. And the introduction of air conditioning brought with it fungi and lichen.</p><p>As a result, the complex was closed to the public in 1963, the prehistoric images returning to the darkness and isolation that they had known for thousands of years.</p><p>Public interest remained unabated, however, and led in 1983 to the opening of Lascaux II, a meticulously created replica cave.</p><p>Its main attraction is the Hall of Bulls Chamber. The four large black bulls in it include one that is over five meters (17ft) long – the largest animal painting in prehistoric cave paintings anywhere in the world.</p><p>Mr Ravidat became an official guardian of the cave and a guide who never lost his initial awe at the sights that he had been the first to see. He died in 1995, aged 72, after a heart attack.</p><p>Lascaux became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. Only a few hundred meters away from the original cave, Lascaux II is a virtually identical replica with 80 per cent of the original images reproduced. It attracts about 250,000 visitors a year.</p><p><b>Published:</b> <i>October 11, 2017</i><br><b>Updated:</b> <i>September 2, 2020</i></p><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Articles on Events in September</h2></a><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/lady-emma-hamilton-sml.jpg alt="Nelson's Dying Wish: Save Emma" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Nelson's Dying Wish: Save Emma</h3><span class=linked_text>Admiral Lord Nelson sailed into the life of Lady Emma Hamilton for the first time on this day.
