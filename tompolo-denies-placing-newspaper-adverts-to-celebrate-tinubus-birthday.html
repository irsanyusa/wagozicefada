I bought the idea wholeheartedly, hence heed the warning and instruction,” he said.</p><p>He expressed confidence in Tinubu's capability in repositioning the country for steady economic growth and prosperity.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tompolo said that he also keyed into the policy thrust of the president to work in synergy with security agencies to eradicate illegal crude oil theft in the Niger Delta.</p><p>He said that those behind the advertisement may have done so in good faith.</p><p>“They may not be aware of the consequences of their action. It is our position that it is a grave error and insensitivity to the current state of things in Nigeria,” he said.</p><p>He, however, expressed deep regret for this action and also apologised to Mr President for any embarrassment this action must have cost him.</p><p>“I apologise to Mr President on behalf of those who placed the adverts, it is highly regretted,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXy1u8yppqWnXZmyr7XErGSppJGYtq%2BzjKecsKuglr2mvoyam6%2BdoqnAbsDOZpqepJWXv6LAxGaroqall8K0ecGiqa2glJbGcLSXsWqbb5o%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
