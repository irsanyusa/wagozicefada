Every song he&nbsp;composes becomes an&nbsp;instant hit&nbsp;— from his love songs, like “Hero,” to&nbsp;his more catchy tunes, such as&nbsp;“Tonight I’m Lovin you.” He’s the son of&nbsp;a&nbsp;very famous singer, so&nbsp;many assume that this is&nbsp;what drove and helped Enrique become an&nbsp;artist. Nothing could be&nbsp;further from the truth&nbsp;— the singer actually owes his huge success to&nbsp;his nanny.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;was born in&nbsp;Spain but wasn’t raised there.</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Born</a> on&nbsp;May&nbsp;8, 1975, in&nbsp;Madrid, Spain, Enrique Iglesias is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most internationally recognized Spanish pop singers. His father is&nbsp;the famous Julio Iglesias, who used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most commercially successful European singer in&nbsp;the world, and his mother is&nbsp;the Filipino model and socialite Isabel Preysler.</p><p>After his parents’ divorce in&nbsp;1978, <a href=#>Enrique</a> and his siblings, Julio and Chabeli, stayed with their mother. They first lived in&nbsp;Spain, later spent a&nbsp;year in&nbsp;Yugoslavia. Finally, when the singer was seven years old, the children went to&nbsp;live with their father in&nbsp;the United States, where they spent most of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> and attended school.</p><p><h2>Enrique and his siblings were raised by&nbsp;Elvira Olivares.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/141/b39/24bffe5874af7c9c5730bfdd6d.jpg><p>His father’s busy schedule meant he&nbsp;couldn’t be&nbsp;home much with his children, so&nbsp;they had a&nbsp;nanny. Elvira Olivares was the one who took care of&nbsp;the boys. For the young Enrique, she became like a&nbsp;<a href=#>second mother</a>, whom he&nbsp;loved and trusted completely. The future artist loved music and secretly composed his own songs as&nbsp;a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;self-expression, and Elvira was the only one who knew about this.</p><p>As&nbsp;Enrique grew older, he&nbsp;became more and more convinced that his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> would not support him if&nbsp;he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;pursue a&nbsp;musical career. He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;rocky relationship with his father, who was demanding and expected a&nbsp;lot from his children. Enrique felt that he&nbsp;would never be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;be&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;his father’s expectations and that he&nbsp;would always be&nbsp;in&nbsp;his shadow. Therefore, <a href=#>like many other children of&nbsp;celebrities</a>, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;carve his own path by&nbsp;keeping the fame of&nbsp;his family name aside.</p><p><h2>His nanny never stopped supporting him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b84/340/33d84f59cd9cf04f04ae039233.jpg><p>When asked about his nanny, the singer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “She is&nbsp;my&nbsp;second mother, the woman who rewarded me&nbsp;when necessary, the person with whom&nbsp;I shared the most time. I&nbsp;love her more than myself, one of&nbsp;the most important people in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. The only one&nbsp;I could trust for a&nbsp;long time.”</p><p>So&nbsp;when he&nbsp;came of&nbsp;age, he&nbsp;turned to&nbsp;her to&nbsp;help him realize his dream of&nbsp;being an&nbsp;artist. She was no&nbsp;longer his nanny, but they had a&nbsp;deeper relationship than that. Enrique needed money to&nbsp;record some of&nbsp;his songs to&nbsp;send to&nbsp;record labels. Elvira, without hesitation, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lent</a> him $500 that she had saved, and, with that money, the future star was able to&nbsp;finance his first demo of&nbsp;three songs.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;didn’t speak to&nbsp;his dad for more than one decade.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b63/943/df3f2c5c99a165ec54c2638f28.jpg><p>When he&nbsp;sent his work to&nbsp;the record companies, he&nbsp;presented himself as&nbsp;Enrique Martínez. He&nbsp;even changed his nationality to&nbsp;Guatemalan so&nbsp;as&nbsp;not to&nbsp;raise any suspicion about his true identity. His father interpreted this attitude as&nbsp;arrogance and disrespect toward him.</p><p>When Julio heard his son’s first album entitled <i>Enrique Iglesias</i>, he&nbsp;got upset. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> it&nbsp;as&nbsp;disastrous and predicted it&nbsp;wouldn’t make any sales. Yet he&nbsp;was wrong. The album began to&nbsp;sell like hotcakes, putting Enrique at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;all the music charts and fueling, even more, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rivalry</a> between <a href=#>father and son</a>, who spent many years without speaking to&nbsp;each other.</p><p><h2>But maturity and time heal all wounds.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d6/0ce/dbe63651b081d9994f371431ff.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;think my&nbsp;father thought that nothing was going to&nbsp;happen, that&nbsp;I wasn’t going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;successful. When I&nbsp;sold a&nbsp;million copies, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>he&nbsp;would say</a>, ’You know, you’re not going to&nbsp;pass a&nbsp;million copies&nbsp;— that’s impossible,’ and then&nbsp;I would end up&nbsp;selling 2&nbsp;million or&nbsp;3&nbsp;million, or&nbsp;4&nbsp;million. Then he’d say, ’Oh, yeah, you sold that many copies, but you’re never going to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;Grammy.’”</p><p>Interestingly, the young Iglesias won the Grammy for Best Latin Pop Performance in&nbsp;1996&nbsp;— the same award that had been given to&nbsp;his father in&nbsp;1987. Enrique was able to&nbsp;achieve success and exceed all of&nbsp;his father’s expectations. He&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;proving his worth and, despite everything, father and son managed to&nbsp;iron out the differences and heal their relationship. And not only that, Enrique became the great <a href=#>pride of&nbsp;his father</a>, who has confessed to&nbsp;eagerly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>listening to&nbsp;his son’s music</a>.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;his private life, he&nbsp;also did things in&nbsp;his own way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d92/017/d2ebca5ebb9b10e0fb72dacd52.jpg><p>Being a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the Iglesias-Preysler family was not easy. Enrique suffered a&nbsp;lot from the estrangement of&nbsp;his family. That’s why, when he&nbsp;formed his own family with the former tennis player Anna Kournikova, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;avoid repeating the same story. He&nbsp;takes an&nbsp;active part in&nbsp;parenthood, and, in&nbsp;spite of&nbsp;his busy schedule, he&nbsp;spends as&nbsp;much time as&nbsp;possible with his little ones and Anna, with whom he&nbsp;has one of&nbsp;the most <a href=#>stable and long-lasting relationships</a> in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;show business.</p><p>He&nbsp;also tries to&nbsp;keep his children away from the media to&nbsp;protect their privacy, and his tours are organized in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that the singer does not have to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>long time</a> apart from his family. He&nbsp;makes sure that they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>keep in&nbsp;touch</a> with their grandparents. Moreover, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;now the one who takes care of&nbsp;Elvira and ensures she lacks nothing, in&nbsp;gratitude for all those years in&nbsp;which she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>took care of&nbsp;him</a> with so&nbsp;much patience and devotion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLKvvsiqrJ5lmZy5pr%2FImqpmqJGuwG7A0aKZrqyVYsGweceiqmamkaO7unnFqKlmoJmoerTBwpycrKuWqrlur8CrnJ6qXW1%2Bc36XbGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
