The woman had her first child at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;66&nbsp;which got her into the Guinness Book of&nbsp;World Records as&nbsp;the oldest mother in&nbsp;the world. Over the past 14&nbsp;years, the woman has had to&nbsp;deal with the rejection from <a href=# title=society data-link=tag>society</a> multiple times, but she has continued to&nbsp;overcome it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the name of&nbsp;her <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> for her daughter.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> were deeply moved by&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;this strong-willed woman that decided to&nbsp;make her dream of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;mother come true against the odds and we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;share it&nbsp;with you.</p><p><h2>Why she didn’t have a&nbsp;child earlier</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf7/567/d5cd6a59a1ae776097636351aa.jpg><p>When Adriana was 20&nbsp;years old, she got married but her husband was completely against having children. In&nbsp;the end, she decided to&nbsp;get divorced. After that, she dedicated herself to&nbsp;her teaching job at&nbsp;a&nbsp;university in&nbsp;Romania.</p><p>For 9&nbsp;years, Adriana was treated for infertility and she tried to&nbsp;get pregnant but all of&nbsp;her attempts were unsuccessful. Then, she <a href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;try in-vitro fertilization. At&nbsp;that moment, she was already 66&nbsp;years old and she clearly understood that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;huge risk. But more than anything else, Adriana wanted to&nbsp;find out what it&nbsp;feels like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother. Many people around her judged her decision and others turned their backs on&nbsp;her thinking that what she was doing was immoral.</p><p><h2>The difficulties Adriana had to&nbsp;deal with after having a&nbsp;baby</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe2/007/c8982358e29ea654e250d7b689.jpg><p>When she finally got pregnant with triplets, 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them died in&nbsp;the womb, and her daughter, Eliza, was born prematurely, so&nbsp;she spent a&nbsp;long time in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>intensive care unit</a>. Soon, she grew stronger and Adriana, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;very religious person, decided to&nbsp;baptize her.</p><p>Different religious organizations claimed that her decision to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;child at&nbsp;such an&nbsp;old age was terribly selfish. During the ceremony, nuns gave her accusing looks and Adriana even heard that one of&nbsp;them called Eliza the product of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dark force. Adriana herself thinks that her daughter was sent by&nbsp;God.</p><p><h2>How this single mother lived with her child as&nbsp;she grew&nbsp;up</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/844/90f/9395bd582f863b2a021c4654fb.jpg><p>Adriana secured the girl’s future right away. She made a&nbsp;deal with the doctor who was doing the in-vitro procedure. They agreed that in&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;Adriana’s death, the doctor is&nbsp;to&nbsp;become the godfather of&nbsp;the girl and her official representative until she is&nbsp;of&nbsp;age.</p><p>Adriana is&nbsp;often thought to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Eliza’s grandmother. And the woman has proved multiple times that her decision to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;mother was something more than just a&nbsp;selfish wish. And since Adriana was already retired, she could spend all of&nbsp;her free time raising her daughter.</p><p><h2>How they live now</h2></p><p>Adriana is&nbsp;a&nbsp;teacher of&nbsp;the Romanian language and literature and also an&nbsp;author of&nbsp;more than 25&nbsp;books for children. Her daughter loves science and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular teenager who has already has won a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;school competitions. In&nbsp;the future, Eliza hopes to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;college.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Adriana</a> and Eliza are connected with the special bonds of&nbsp;love. As&nbsp;her mother, Adriana invests all of&nbsp;her power, experience, and knowledge into her only daughter. She still has an&nbsp;active and <a href=# title="healthy lifestyle" data-link=tag>healthy lifestyle</a> and tries to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;Eliza’s social life. Adriana is&nbsp;83&nbsp;years old now, she feels great, and she hopes to&nbsp;continue watching her daughter grow into a&nbsp;beautiful woman.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about Adriana’s story?
