That would explain why the human race that appears in Penn’s new book, a career summation called Passage (Knopf-Callaway; $100), looks so different from the one that we see in Photographs Annie Leibovitz 1970-1990 (HarperCollins; $60).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Or maybe it’s just a small, exotic slice of humanity that has changed, the subspecies called celebrities. The decorous public figures in Penn’s photographs have become Leibovitz’s feral children. Buck naked, streaked with paint or hanging from trees, they sport through the pages of her book and across the walls of the International Center of Photography in New York City, where a retrospective of Leibovitz’s work is on view through Dec. 1, before traveling across the U.S. and Europe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Penn’s world, reputation counts for more than celebrity, and fame is no laughing matter. Posed against bare backgrounds and pressed by mortal shadows, his stalwart artists and writers are icons of modernism at its most brave, clean and reverent. Their solemnity may be a pose in itself, but it has its metaphorical power. Penn’s fashion shots take on greater weight in the company of his portraits; the passage of time seems to hang over them both. They in turn magnify the effect of a third kind of picture that he started taking in 1967, when he began to haul his neutral backdrops around the world and put before them tribal warriors in New Guinea or the women of Cameroon.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At around the same time Penn was also photographing hippies and Hell’s Angels, so he would have known that it was no longer necessary to travel very far to fall off the edges of Western civilization: the tribal types were gathering at home. One of their favorite spots was the backstage world of rock, where Leibovitz started shooting for Rolling Stone in 1970. It was a place where parents imagined that the wickedness of paganism converged with the self-indulgence of childhood, as if the Satyricon were being played out in the aisles of Toys “R” Us. Judging from a few of Leibovitz’s early pictures — like one of rock drummer Keith Moon trysting with his groupies — those parents had a point. Rock had become the gateway through which the mysterious Other — dark, hedonistic, erotically charged — would find its way out into mass culture.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What few suspected was how quickly all of that could be put to the service of marketing, in rock videos and ad campaigns. Leibovitz has been a crucial figure in this transition. In her most talked-about portraits of the past decade, she brought a pagan abandon to the authorized depiction of celebrities, a bit of primeval fire for the image machine. All those masks and naked flesh, all that mud and body paint: what Penn found in West Africa, Leibovitz brings out in Keith Haring, Lauren Hutton and Roseanne Barr. In the 1970s she discovered that Mick Jagger looked like a wicked faun. A decade later, she applied that look to Jeff Koons, ’80s art buffoon and husband of the Euro-porn star and Italian legislatrix Cicciolina. Naked, painted gold, Koons is a naughty sprite who darts a little pink tongue. By the time Leibovitz made her famous cover shot of Demi Moore, pregnant and unclothed, it was hard not to see the actress as the photographer’s own version of a fertility goddess.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The paradox of Leibovitz’s best-known work is that it tries to twit propriety in the slickest possible style. Which may be why so many of her subjects, no matter how manically they act up for the camera, are prone to look shrink-wrapped in their own renown. In these rich, sanitary frames, the antics can fall flat, the Bette Midlers and Steve Martins can emanate nothing so much as the fact of their famousness. In pictures that are bright, clear and eye-catching, they become the corporate logos of their own celebrity. This must be what a primal impulse looks like after it has been fully digested by the world of public relations, ad agencies and department stores. We have met the Others. They “R” Us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9uanBmbINwv8eam6ivo2Kur7CMnrCeZZOWu6XFjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
