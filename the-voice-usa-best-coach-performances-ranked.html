Since each coach has a history in the industry on their own, the show often has them combine their talents for one, impressive, performance.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-top-8-the-voice-coach-performances>Top 8 The Voice Coach Performances</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-havana-by-camila-cabello>8. “Havana” by Camila Cabello</h3><p>To celebrate <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Camila Cabello</a>‘s inauguration into The Voice family, coaches celebrated by performing her hit. Cabello’s hit song is, of course, begun by her, then handed off to John Legend, Gwen Stefani, and Blake Shelton. In my opinion, the best part of this performance is Cabello and Legend, while Shelton looks a bit like a lost puppy. He’s so painfully out of his genre here, but he’s trying his best to keep up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-jealous-by-nick-jonas>7. “Jealous” by Nick Jonas</h3><p>Similar to Cabello, The Voice welcomed on Nick Jonas by having the coaches sing his hit “Jealous.” Unfortunately, once again, it felt like Shelton was a bit lost when it came to his verses, and I’m not sure why. All of the other coaches seriously slayed this performance though.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-take-it-easy-by-the-eagles>6. “Take It Easy” by The Eagles</h3><p>This Season (Season 24) coach performance features Niall Horan, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reba McEntire</a>, John Legend, and Gwen Stefani. This country take on The Eagles is a great listen, but not my overall favorite. I think this song was a good compromise between the artists the show has, but it wasn’t my favorite.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-respect-by-aretha-franklin>5. “Respect” by Aretha Franklin</h3><p>During The Voice Season 21, coaches Ariana Grande, Kelly Clarkson, John Legend, and Blake Shelton began the season out by getting funky. The performance begins with Grande and Clarkson, then gets handed over to Shelton and Legend, who sing backup wonderfully. This performance got a lower ranking because it felt like all Shelton and Legend were doing was singing backup.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-crazy-by-gnarls-barkley>4. “Crazy” by Gnarls Barkley</h3><p>The Voice Season One coaches Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera, Ceelo Green, and Blake Shelton impressed right away, to show what this show is all about. Each coach was able to belt their part out perfectly during this joint performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-can-t-take-my-eyes-off-you-by-bob-crewe-and-bob-gaudio>3. “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” by Bob Crewe and Bob Gaudio</h3><p>I’m not ashamed to admit that The Voice Season 23 performance featuring Niall Horan, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chance The Rapper</a>, Blake Shelton, and Kelly Clarkson, is one of my favorites. Although these artists come from a variety of different genres and backgrounds, they were able to join together for this beautiful rendition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-dream-on-by-aerosmith>2. “Dream On” by Aerosmith</h3><p>There is absolutely nothing better than a Alicia Keys ballad… unless you add Miley Cyrus, Blake Shelton, and Adam Levine. This track truly fit all four of the coaches perfectly, resulting in a flawless performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-medley-of-each-other-s-hits>1. Medley of Each Other’s Hits</h3><p>This performance will always be my favorite, since this is the whole point of the series. Each artist is known individually, so it’s only right for them to all sing each other’s hits. Shakira, Blake Shelton, Usher, and Adam Levine truly proved themselves as versatile artists with this performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_AliciaKeys_Paul-MorigiGetty-Images-for-National-Portrait-Gallery-220x213.jpg alt="Alicia Keys Semi-Autobiographical Musical “Hell’s Kitchen” Headed to Broadway in Spring" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedSsmGaalajBbq%2FOmpqhZaCav6e70aaYp5uVqHqzrc2knJ1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
