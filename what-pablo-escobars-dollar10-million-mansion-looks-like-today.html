Situated on the headland of the artificial Guatapé reservoir, the residence offered incredible views of the surrounding area. Escobar, who at the time controlled most of the world's <a href=# id=885c5c1b-635e-4a50-9e08-0e34087a6457 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>cocaine trade</a>, could admire the lake to the opposite shore.</p><p>However, La Manuela was not just home to Escobar's family. It was also a manifestation of the excessive wealth that Escobar had accumulated through drug smuggling. The beautiful facade of the mansion where cocaine and cash were hidden becomes a symbol of this contradiction. The shadow of disaster always loomed over this place.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-a08f3a0c-a525-4882-8e20-9a9c4fb4df10 data-caption="The Finca La Manuela is a ghost of its former self [AFP]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/gtHktkpTURBXy8zMGViZGRjNmNkZDEwYjgxNzI2YTg3Mzk5YWEwZmE2ZS5qcGeSlQMAAM0DwM0CgJUCzQMWzQIPwsM></span><p>Despite its picturesque location, Finca La Manuela has become a symbol of the violence that Pablo Escobar's drug cartel brought to the entire country. On the estate, there was a watchtower with a tower and a contingent of about 120 soldiers. In 1993, rival drug gang Pepes carried out an attack that ultimately destroyed large parts of the villa and estate.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>After the explosion, police confiscated cash and drugs from the villa. Fate did not spare Escobar himself. Just eight months after the explosion, <a href=# id=a08d5a91-ac57-4016-8f67-72822adafac3 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>he was shot dead by authorities in Medellín</a>. His wife escaped with their two children, Manuela and her brother. Since then, the estate and its ruined buildings have remained abandoned.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-5d52131e-6786-4868-b4a8-e2ec7881fbec data-caption="What was once a symbol of luxury now lies in ruins [AFP]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/nuLktkpTURBXy9mZmMwNzI4NmU4ODViMjU2OWFmNDJjMDllMzcyOTM4Ni5qcGeSlQMAAM0Dv80CgZUCzQMWzQIRwsM></span><p>Today, the destroyed ruins of Finca La Manuela are becoming a tourist attraction. Tourists from all over the world are drawn to this place to see the traces of its turbulent past up close. Boat trips and guided tours offer insight into the life of Escobar and his family, and bring to life the era of Colombian <a href=# id=7784e738-9c67-4c95-ad82-7412e571db52 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>cocaine smuggling</a>.</p><p>But visitors also learn how hard Colombia is working to leave behind the dark legacy of the drug cartel era. To show that the country has much more to offer than its past characterised by drug trafficking and violence, Colombia is increasingly focusing on cultural and ecological tourism.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-c170659f-9964-4d06-aa06-8c845fdf660a data-caption="Tourists are attracted to the ruins of the Finca La Manuela estate [AFP]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/E2YktkpTURBXy8wZjE3N2M1OWMwZDY3Y2ZlM2U0M2M2NzVkYmY5NjY2Ni5qcGeSlQMAAM0Dv80CfpUCzQMWzQIOwsM></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cMPHmqtmqJGXubB5xKyaqJqRp8BusM6lo5qqYWV6rrXLpaCopl2irq%2B%2FyKilZqSfpLi0ecuiop5lpKSxosWOsJqbnGCifg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
