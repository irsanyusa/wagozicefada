It’s pretty hard to impress judges painting anything, especially in only two minutes. The ability to perform speed art usually comes with some extra skills other than artistry. That’s certainly the case for The Naked Painter who completed a portrait using his trademark paintbrush aka the PENIS!</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-naked-painter-shows-his-stroke-of-genius>The Naked Painter Shows His Stroke of Genius</h2><p>In the tenth season of&nbsp;France’s Got Talent, we saw the risque artist, <a href=#>Brent Ray Fraser</a>, take a couple of&nbsp;strokes&nbsp;to his canvas. A man as sculpted as a Greek statue took the stage wearing only jeans covered in paint. If it wasn’t confusing seeing this half-naked beefcake walking out to an easel, it took another turn when he tears away the pants. Jaws hit the floor as he begins to cover his unit in paint and gets to work on his canvas.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a href=#>ALL OF THE PROVOCATIVE OUTFITS THAT GOT AMANDA HOLDEN IN TROUBLE ON ‘BGT’</a></strong></p><p>With his tool in one hand, he tosses the canvas with the other, strategically planting his “brush strokes.” He hypes the crowd to fill the time as he mysteriously works his medium. Finally, after a few cringy moments, the masterpiece is revealed to be a portrait of long-time judge Gilbert Rozon. As uncomfortable as it was, the artistry was impressive and the judges couldn’t hold their laughter as all said yes.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-art-that-s-too-hot-to-handle>Art That’s Too Hot To Handle</h3><p>The racy act isn’t for everyone, however. The Canadian phallus painter has appeared in other talent competitions. Fraser made an attempt at&nbsp;<a href=#>Supertalent Croatia&nbsp;</a>where his audition didn’t go over as well. Immediately after he disrobed, he got a buzzer from judge Martina Tomcic who soon after left the set as his act continued. In his native&nbsp;<a href=#>Canada’s Got Talent</a>,&nbsp;he didn’t get to complete his act getting 3 buzzes before he was ever nude.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>This risque of an act could never fly on our network airwaves. Even in places where he can perform on-air, it’s still not for everyone. Who knows what talent competition he’ll appear in next (if there are any others that allow such nudity on network TV). A safe guess is that Simon Cowell won’t be posing for a portrait from The Naked Painter anytime soon.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>CONTESTANT LEAVES SIMON COWELL SPEECHLESS AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>For the painter, at least&nbsp;France’s Got Talent&nbsp;has three other judges still left to paint.&nbsp;What do you think about this act?
