And the 54-year-old actor’s real personality and views on&nbsp;life aren’t any less fascinating than that of&nbsp;<a href=# title=007 data-link=tag>007</a>. In&nbsp;fact, even though the A-lister is&nbsp;an&nbsp;enigma and insists on&nbsp;leading a&nbsp;private life, the things we&nbsp;know about him are enough to&nbsp;make&nbsp;us get attached to&nbsp;him all the more.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>admires the man behind this beloved character. We&nbsp;want to&nbsp;share 10&nbsp;things about Daniel Craig that prove the ’’perfect man’’ may actually exist after all.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;has a&nbsp;heart of&nbsp;gold.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a5/043/b1d6c2536694cdaf8dce1035c5.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>list</a> of&nbsp;charities that Daniel Craig supports is&nbsp;very long. In&nbsp;fact, the successful actor devotes large sums of&nbsp;his money and time to&nbsp;support various causes close to&nbsp;his heart, whether they are big organizations or&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;smaller scale. For example, it&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reported</a> that he&nbsp;donated $10,000 last year to&nbsp;3&nbsp;fathers who set out on&nbsp;a&nbsp;300-mile walk to&nbsp;raise funds for a&nbsp;charity.</p><p><h2>4&nbsp;people attended his wedding.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/274/471/bb6e675bd4bd5dd21291c8af3f.jpg><p>Charles Sykes/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;2011, Craig <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> actress Rachel Weisz, and their union seems like a&nbsp;match made in&nbsp;Hollywood heaven. Yet the 2&nbsp;stars lead a&nbsp;life far from all the excess and glamour that one would imagine. In&nbsp;fact, their <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a> was the most intimate affair ever.</p><p>The couple said their ’’I dos’’ in&nbsp;New York with only 4&nbsp;guests in&nbsp;attendance&nbsp;— and 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them were their kids from previous marriages: Craig’s then 18-year-old daughter, Ella, and Weisz’s 4-year-old son, Henry.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;leads a&nbsp;low-key life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24e/f2f/085e0a536bb88091ff91c65d0b.jpg><p>Getty Images/AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>Just like their quiet wedding, the couple is&nbsp;very low-key in&nbsp;their everyday life. In&nbsp;fact, Weisz and Craig are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>known</a> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;“one of&nbsp;the most private couples in&nbsp;Hollywood.” Little is&nbsp;known about their personal life in&nbsp;the media, however, they are very supportive of&nbsp;each other’s work, as&nbsp;Weisz noted, “We&nbsp;respect each other. We&nbsp;appreciate each other’s work.”</p><p>So&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems that the pair leads the perfect cozy life, and it&nbsp;was reported that they enjoy doing regular activities just like the rest of&nbsp;us. An&nbsp;insider said, ’’The 2&nbsp;love talking about books and poetry, and apparently, they love cooking together.’’</p><p><h2>He’s a&nbsp;hands-on dad.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/734/d78/7c694f5a15bf6755486e2b26e2.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>At&nbsp;50, Craig became a&nbsp;dad for the second time after <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>welcoming</a> a&nbsp;daughter with his wife. It&nbsp;was reported that the James Bond star “wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;hands-on dad” and is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>committed</a> to&nbsp;devoting his energy and time to&nbsp;raising his newborn instead of&nbsp;leaving her to&nbsp;the care of&nbsp;nannies. The doting dad was also spotted on&nbsp;the street wearing a&nbsp;papoose carrier.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;almost turned down the role of&nbsp;James Bond.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/41a/de0/0d10c25f85a1c1f0c22586557a.jpg><p>TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/East News</p><p>Needless to&nbsp;say that landing the highly coveted and iconic role of&nbsp;James Bond is&nbsp;something that the majority of&nbsp;Hollywood actors dream&nbsp;of, yet the actor explained that he&nbsp;was hesitant to&nbsp;accept this challenge, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it.”</p><p>He&nbsp;noted that the previous Bond actors, such as&nbsp;Pierce Brosnan or&nbsp;Roger Moore, had already played roles, which proved that they could embody James Bond. On&nbsp;the other hand, he&nbsp;admitted, “I&nbsp;had done weird arty movies. [...] I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I wouldn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;it.” Luckily, the producers of&nbsp;the franchise believed in&nbsp;him and insisted that he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the perfect Bond, and were eventually able to&nbsp;change his mind.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;dye his hair.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bbc/dce/be310e557c92b726cdf6cc3eff.jpg><p>Kiera Fyles, PacificCoastNews/EAST NEWS</p><p>Despite being constantly pressured from the directors, the actor categorically <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>refused</a> to&nbsp;turn his blond hair brown, stating that it&nbsp;was “out of&nbsp;the question.” He&nbsp;added, “I&nbsp;suggested instead that&nbsp;I could cut my&nbsp;hair really short to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;more brutal appearance.” This makes Craig the first and only <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>blond</a> Bond to&nbsp;this date.</p><p>And years later, as&nbsp;his hair started to&nbsp;gray, the actor, again, had put his foot down and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>insisted</a> that 007 would grow old gracefully without dying his gray hair.</p><p><h2>He’s a&nbsp;great kisser.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/113/4d3/bc39ba52d782cfc994d3c796f6.jpg><p>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>Before taking on&nbsp;the iconic role of&nbsp;007, Craig acted in&nbsp;the 2001 action film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</i></a>, opposite Angelina Jolie. And the actress who has undoubtedly starred opposite many dashing men in&nbsp;Hollywood has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>called</a> Craig “one of&nbsp;the best kissers” in&nbsp;the industry. In&nbsp;response to&nbsp;this praise, the actor said that he&nbsp;felt “honored” and then added, “She’s not bad herself.”</p><p><h2>He’s a&nbsp;talented cook.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a8c/5c4/a273605447bd9ecaf6f8c57bc8.jpg><p>It&nbsp;seems that Craig’s talent goes beyond the camera. In&nbsp;fact, the star admitted that he&nbsp;enjoys cooking and that he&nbsp;learned how thanks to&nbsp;his mother’s advice. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that his mom told him, “If&nbsp;I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;eat, I’d better know how to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;myself.”</p><p>Moreover, Craig even worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;chef before making it&nbsp;big in&nbsp;acting. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a>, “I&nbsp;love to&nbsp;cook.” He&nbsp;then added, “I&nbsp;can’t cook for a&nbsp;few, because I’m used to&nbsp;cooking for 20&nbsp;or more at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time. So&nbsp;there are always a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;leftovers.”</p><p><h2>He’s 100% committed to&nbsp;his craft.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ac/869/5a918950a29893833f6e6f404a.jpg><p>Saturday Night Live/Ferrari Press/East News</p><p>Portraying an&nbsp;iconic secret service agent on-screen doesn’t come without a&nbsp;cost, and Craig follows an&nbsp;intense fitness regimen so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;can give his best performance, which includes <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pushing</a> his physical limits to&nbsp;the max. In&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;was reported that Craig did his own stunts more than any other actor who has portrayed 007 in&nbsp;the past. Bond’s chief stunt coordinator has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that the actor “gets his hands very dirty,” and this has resulted in&nbsp;numerous injuries throughout his career, including losing his 2&nbsp;front teeth while filming a&nbsp;fight scene for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Casino Royale</i></a>.</p><p>However, playing the charismatic and super famous 007 doesn’t mean that Craig wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;typecast in&nbsp;one genre. In&nbsp;fact, the talented performer isn’t afraid of&nbsp;taking risks and doesn’t take himself so&nbsp;seriously by&nbsp;doing unexpected comedic appearances, such as&nbsp;being a&nbsp;surprise <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>guest</a> on&nbsp;SNL.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;doesn’t believe in&nbsp;inheritance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8b/32f/06444d587dbb627c561f3ed1d2.jpg><p>Being one of&nbsp;Hollywood’s biggest leading men has allowed Craig to&nbsp;amass a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fortune</a> that is&nbsp;reportedly worth $160&nbsp;million. Nevertheless, it&nbsp;seems that his oldest daughter, 29-year-old Ella, and his 4-year-old daughter with Rachel Weisz surprisingly will not be&nbsp;enjoying a&nbsp;big chunk of&nbsp;his wealth.</p><p>The actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that he&nbsp;finds inheritance “distasteful,” saying that he&nbsp;doesn’t want “to&nbsp;leave great sums to&nbsp;the next generation.” Craig added, “My&nbsp;philosophy is&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;it&nbsp;or&nbsp;give it&nbsp;away before you&nbsp;go.”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think of&nbsp;Daniel Craig?
