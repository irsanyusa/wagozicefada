Dee Dee brought down the house with a powerful performance of “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” from Dreamgirls.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dee-dee-simon-wows-in-agt-early-release-audition>Dee Dee Simon Wows in AGT Early Release Audition</h2><p>Dee Dee told the judges that she’s from Oakland, California, and she has worked as a registered nurse at a prison for 19 years. She shared that the first time she sang at work, a riot broke out, and she had to triage the inmates. She finally tried again two months before her audition, and “it was peace.”</p><p>When asked what her dream is, Dee Dee said there’s a door that she’s never gotten to go through. She explained that her dream is to finally go through that door, while taking care of her family. Simon Cowell told her they were “all rooting for you.”</p><p>Dee Dee went on to perform the iconic song “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” showing off a powerhouse voice. She got so into the performance, she actually kicked her shoes off at one point. By the end of the song, she was down on one knee.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SIMON COWELL HITS TWO GOLDEN BUZZERS AS ‘AGT’ AUDITIONS CONTINUE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-the-judges-think-of-the-audition>What Did the Judges Think of the Audition?</h2><p>The judges and audience gave Dee Dee a standing ovation for the performance. Sofia Vergara said she “thought it was spectacular,” saying it was “a beautiful treat to have you here tonight.” Meanwhile, Heidi Klum called her “one of the best singers we’ve had this season.”</p><p>“You said, ‘Every time I went to that door, something happened and I couldn’t go through the door,'” Howie Mandel said. “And I think that you are out, you are free. Welcome to the world that you deserve to be in.”</p><p>Cowell told Dee Dee that things would be better for her tomorrow. When asked if she had a dedication for her performance, she said, “To everyone that was told no. Keep going, ’cause one yes can change your life.”</p><p>Dee Dee got more than one yes — she got four, from the entire panel of judges. Watch her audition, as well as plenty more, when AGT returns on Tuesday night at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Original_Mandisa_Jason-Merritt_FilmMagic-for-Fox-Television-Network-220x147.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Season 5 Alum Mandisa’s Cause of Death Revealed" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKloJ2iYq%2Btu9asZK2glWK%2FsLvFZqafnl2strW0jJ2pnpmdnLazuNJmmqiulad6qrqMmp6tZZWWv63FjKucpZ2RqLJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
