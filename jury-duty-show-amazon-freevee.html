Jury Duty explores the progression of a <a href=#>civil trial</a> in California through the eyes of one very special juror, Ronald Gladden.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While filming for 17 days in 2021, Gladden believed he was serving on a sequestered jury, while participating in a documentary. Little did he know that everyone else involved in the process, from his fellow jurors to the bailiff to the judge, were actors, all performing a series of partly-scripted, partly-improvised antics.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gladden turns out to be the perfect subject for the comedy docuseries. An easygoing, genuine, and amenable participant simply doing his best to be a good citizen, he bonds with his fellow jurors, including a range of people from a narcissistic, self-involved version of James Marsden (played by Marsden himself) to Todd Gregory (David Brown), a lovable oddball who, in one of the series’ best moments, Gladden decides would <a href=# rel=noopener>benefit from watching Pixar’s A Bug’s Life.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ronald-Gladden-and-James-Marsden-star-in-22Jury-Duty.22-.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“One of the things we talked about from the beginning was we wanted a show that never felt like it was punching down and felt optimistic, that had the tropes and the tone of something like The Office but really had a warmth and an optimism to it as well,” series co-creator Lee Eisenberg told <a href=# rel=noopener>Vulture</a>. “When we saw Ronald’s tape, we couldn’t believe it. He’s such a nice guy. He’s funny, he’s charming, he’s witty. That’s what we had hoped for.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Executive producer Todd Schulman went on to explain how they found Gladden by putting out a Craigslist ad. “We went with Craigslist because it is a kind of democratic process,” he told Vulture. “If you go through casting, you’re going to find a lot of actors. We wanted to get people who were genuine human beings living in the real world, not people in the Hollywood ecosystem.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gladden—who found out what was really going on while shooting the end of the show—even had a little trouble getting back to his real life after learning he had been secretly filmed. “After everything was revealed and then after I came home for the weekend, I started getting paranoid,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>TV Guide</a>. “I started freaking out and I was like, ‘I feel like I’m being followed,’ so I was texting James [Marsden] and I was telling him this. James just being the wonderful person that he is, he called me up. We talked on the phone for like 30-45 minutes and he just helped me accept reality, accept fate. He reassured me there were no cameras following me around and he really helped me start working through those emotions.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since premiering on April 7, Jury Duty has blown up on TikTok, with fans of the series creating <a href=# rel=noopener>fancam edits</a> of Gladden and the hashtag #JuryDutyOnFreevee garnering over 206 million views on the platform. “This is not even an ad I’m just urging u to watch bc it’s a hilarious show,” one user captioned a <a href=# rel=noopener>popular TikTok</a> that has received more than 3.2 million likes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gladden himself now has over 94 thousand followers on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, a development that’s apparently come as a shock to him. “I really didn’t think a lot of people were gonna see this,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>GQ</a>. “That’s one of the reasons I was okay with doing this. And then while we were doing it, once I realized that James was gonna be in it, I was like, ‘Okay, maybe a few million people might end up seeing this because we’ve got a Hollywood superstar now.’ But I never, I never imagined it’d be like this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamdphHF%2BjqOsq7FdmcK1xYysn6ivXZa6osbOp2SfqpWaw6axjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
