For many Christian denominations, Easter is considered to be a more important event.</p><p>When it comes to the question of what they think the most important Christian holiday is, for half of British Christians it’s Easter (49%), whilst just over four in ten put Christmas (42%).</p><p>We also asked the British public in general (including both those who are and are not religious) which is the most important event in the Christian calendar and Easter (41%) came slightly ahead of Christmas (38%).</p><p>There is a generational split here. In the 16-24 age group, more find Christmas important (40%) than Easter (33%); also, for those in their mid-20s and 30s, Christmas ranks higher (40%) in importance than the Easter celebrations (27%). On the other end of the scale are those in their forties and above who give more importance to the holiday celebrating the resurrection of Jesus (42% among those aged 40-59, and 46% for those 60 and older), whilst Christmas ranks lower.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/important_christian_event_christmas_easter.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>More specifically, when it comes to the importance of Christian religious holidays for those who celebrate them, Christmas comes first.</p><p>Amongst those who celebrate Christmas, half (50%) say it is ‘very important’ and a further 38% say it’s ‘somewhat important’ to them. One in eight who celebrate Christmas (12%) say it isn’t important to them.</p><p>When it comes to Easter, a quarter of those who celebrate (25%) say it’s a very important event for them and for four in ten (41%) it’s ‘somewhat important’. However, a third (33%) don’t give any importance to this holiday despite celebrating it.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/important_celebrate_christmas_easter.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Britons on how Christmas and Easter are celebrated in the UK today</h3><p>Over eight in ten Britons (83%) think that Christmas nowadays is more celebrated as a secular than a religious event. Just 8% think the opposite.</p><p>Britons are more likely to think that Easter is still celebrated as a religious event, although at 29% it is still very much a minority view. Overall, six in ten (59%) think Easter has turned more into a secular than a religious occasion.</p><p>Around eight in ten Britons say that (82%) say that the religious aspects of Christmas celebrations are declining, with seven in ten (72%) saying the same of Easter. Among those who feel this way about each festival, similar numbers share their take on whether this is a good or bad thing. Around four in ten (40-42%) who think the religious significance of Christmas and Easter is in decline say this is a bad thing, while 18% say it is a good thing and 37-40% say it is neither a good nor bad thing.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/religious_decrease_christmas_easter_good_ba.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>A third of the British public (34%) think that the religious aspects of celebrating Christmas should be emphasized more than they are currently, while 31% say the same for Easter. Similar proportions think things should stay as they are (29% for Christmas, 33% for Easter), whilst a fifth (18-19%) would like to see religion even further diluted from the festivities.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/religious_decreasing_christmas_easter.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Merry Christmas or Season’s greetings?</h3><p>When it comes to the way we prefer to be greeted for Christmas, the overwhelming majority of Britons (78%) say they prefer "Merry Christmas’, whilst just 5% are in favour of a more neutral ‘Season’s greetings’.</p><p>One in nine (11%), however, say they don’t like either of the greetings.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/prefer_merry_christmas_seasons_greetings.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhrY2p9eHnWoZitZZSkeqS00aKqraWRqHqiusNmnJqrpJq%2FbrnEmqVmmqKewaK1zQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
