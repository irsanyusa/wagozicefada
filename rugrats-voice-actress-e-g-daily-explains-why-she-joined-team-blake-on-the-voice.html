Daily once competed on <a href=#>The Voice.</a> Even though she’s known for her roles as Tommy Pickles on Rugrats, Buttercup in The Powerpuff Girls Movie, and more, she’s also a singer.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-voice-actress-e-g-daily-competed-on-the-voice-in-2013>Voice Actress E.G. Daily Competed on The Voice in 2013</h2><p>E.G. Daily began her career singing in a band at the age of 15, but eventually began acting. in the 1980’s she appeared in Pee-wee’s Big Adventure and Valley Girl. A year later she became the most sought-after voice-over artist. Her most notable character at the time was Tommy Pickles on Rugrats.</p><p>Even though she succeeded in the world of voice acting, she took the stage on The Voice for a second chance at a singing career. Daily now states that she would have never expected to be on The Voice. She shared that she auditioned for the series due to her mindset shift. During that time she had fallen into a period of not doing what she love, so she decided to only agree to opportunities that made her say “h*ll yeah!” Originally Daily had agreed sing and host music show.</p><p>“She said, ‘I hope you’re not mad but I got you an audition for The Voice. I was like ‘oh no, I can’t, I can’t’,” Daily said. “Then I was like I have to say yes because I love singing.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/hA3OwUESg38</p></figure><p>Daily first appeared on The Voice‘s season five singing “<a href=#>Breathe</a>” by Faith Hill. Her raspy voice turned the chairs of both Blake Shelton and Cee Lo Green. She picked Blake Shelton as her coach and continued on in the competition on Team Blake.</p><p>This singer returned to the stage singing “Something To Talk About” by Bonnie Raitt in the battle rounds and “I Can’t Make You Love Me” by the same artist in the knockout rounds. Even though her voice was powerful in both performances, she was eliminated during the knockout rounds.</p><p>Daily attributes her history of singing and using different voices in a play as the reason she became a voice actress. The voice actress noted that someone overheard her contorting her voice during the play and told her that voice acting was something she should get into. Her first audition was for Tommy Pickles on Rugrats and obviously the rest was history.</p><p>It’s clear in 2022 that she still enjoys her voice acting career, but hasn’t stopped singing. On top of her successful voice acting, Daily is still a singer in the current day. She recently was featured as the singer of “We Got The Beat” on the Go-Go’s tribute album.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1176081636.jpg alt="Backstreet Boys Resume DNA World Tour with New European Dates" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570a6eq5mkqHq3u8icnGaZk6m%2Fpr%2FSZpxmn12Zrqq42Gacsaiclravv4ywn7Jlo52ybrbOoqWenF2psqK5jJujmqOVYryvedOhnGaun56wpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
