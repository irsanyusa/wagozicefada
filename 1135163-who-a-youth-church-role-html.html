In return, it benefits from their contributions to the church and the Christian community. Below are some roles the youth play in the church:</p><h3>1. Bring new members to church through evangelism</h3><p class=align-left>Christian youth increase the number of people in the church by evangelizing to fellow youth at school, home, workplace, etc. Most churches also host youth seminars and conferences for evangelical purposes. On top of this, most church choir members are the youth, including those who play instruments. These young people use their singing talents to draw more youth to church.</p><p class=align-left>When Christian youth marry in their adult years, they <a href=#>can</a> influence their spouses, children, and, to some extent, the in-laws, to join the church. As a result, the population of church and Christian communities increases because of the youth.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cbe9e863d89ac68b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"I want to stay committed to principles of Jesus": Man opens foundation to help orphans, widows</span></p></a><h3>2. They bring fresh and progressive ideas to the church</h3><p class=align-left>The youth have modern progressive concepts that develop the church and the Christian community. They can use social media/content evangelism (Christian influencers and content creators), email evangelism (e.g., newsletters), mobile evangelism (e.g., Bible text messages), print media evangelism (billboards, brochures, flyers, newsletters, posters, etc.), and other strategies to <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1134752-prayer-points-breakthrough-bible-verses.html href=#>spread the word of God</a> in society.</p><h3>3. They are caregivers to the needy members in society and the church</h3><p class=align-left>There is so much the youth ministry can do to help the underprivileged and needy members in society and the church. They can monetize their social media/content evangelism, mobile evangelism, print media evangelism, and email evangelism concepts to raise money for charity projects and programs.</p><p class=align-left>The youth also provide the church labor during these charity projects and programs. For instance, they cook during a community feeding event, distribute donations to the beneficiaries of the church charity programs, etc.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/058483a7f4782e53.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"No more N10m": Australia announces new student visa rules, closes door Nigerians exploit for cheaper studies</span></p></a><h3>4. They are the caretakers of the church's assets and properties</h3><p class=align-left>The youth are the custodians and caretakers of assets in the church and other property belonging to the church. In most churches, the youth clean inside the church building, take care of the compound, arrange the seats during church services, connect the sound system, and so on.</p><h3>5. They are the voice of the church and the Christian community</h3><p class=align-left>The lifestyle of a devoted Christian youth speaks a lot about the church in society. The <a href=#>world</a> has many successful Christian youths whose lives alone inspire the world to join the religion. As a result, many non-believers have been convinced to convert to Christianity after observing the lifestyles of youths dedicated to their faith.</p><h3>Characteristics of youth in the church</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7b704b1e3a07022c.png><p class=align-left>You must shape your character into a Christian youth who adds value to the church and community.

Discrimination based on gender, race, cultural background, colorism, and so on</h4><p class=align-left>The youth in the church today face discrimination in different forms, which hinders them from interacting with one another within and outside the church setting. Church leaders should preach unity, create programs to make the youth interact without bias, and discourage adults from instilling discrimination ideas in young people.</p><h4>2.

Gender identity crisis</h4><p class=align-left>Many young people today are battling with a gender identity crisis. The church should create a safe space for these young people to share their thoughts and emotions without being judged. After that, the church leaders and parents should guide them through a Godly self-discovery process.</p><h4>4. Additions to harmful substances</h4><p class=align-left>Youths are addicted to alcohol, adult content movies, narcotics, and many other things ruining their lives. The church should cooperate with medical professionals, therapists, life coaches, rehabilitation centers, etc., to help these young people overcome addictions and rebuild their lives.</p><h4>5. Fornication and immorality</h4><p class=align-left>Young people with promising futures are falling apart because of fornication and other sexual immoralities.

The youth should spread the Gospel</h4><p class=align-left>The Bible encourages young people to evangelize to the <a href=#>word of God</a>. No one is too young to teach others about God's word and commandments.</p><ul><li>Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you were born, I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.’ ‘Ah, Sovereign LORD,’ I said, ‘I do not know how to speak; I am only a child.’ But the LORD said to me, ‘Do not say, ‘I am only a child.’ You must go to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you. Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,’ declares the LORD. Then the LORD reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, ‘Now, I have put my words in your mouth.’ - <i>Jeremiah 1:4-9</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5e464880049f1bff.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 interesting facts on Cuba to encourage your wanderlust</span></p></a><h4>2.

They should set godly goals in life</h4><p class=align-left>The Bible encourages them to follow their dreams and enjoy their youth but cautions them from activities that bring them more harm than good. There are consequences for every action.</p><ul><li>Be happy while you are still young. Do what you want to do, and follow your heart’s desire. But remember that God is going to judge you for whatever you do. Don’t let anything worry you or cause you pain. You aren’t going to be young very long. - <i>Ecclesiastes 11:9-10</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ac7f4b9f76903ccb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting facts about Pisces: weakness, secret power, soulmate</span></p></a><h4>4.
