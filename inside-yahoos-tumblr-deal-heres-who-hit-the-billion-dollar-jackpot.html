But 24-hours after the deal was officially&nbsp;<a href=#>announced</a>, a few things are certain: The deal represents a landmark event for <a href=#>New York City</a>‘s tech startup scene, and a handful of Tumblr employees and investors are now extremely wealthy.</p><p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the big winners and how much they made on the deal:</p><strong>Founder David Karp: $253 million</strong> Karp, the 26-year-old high school dropout who founded the company six years ago, owns approximately 25% of Tumblr and is set to reap $253 million in cash as a result, according to data compiled by PrivCo,&nbsp;a New York-based research firm that tracks private companies and the venture capital industry. Karp’s net worth had already been estimated at $200 million after Tumblr’s most recent venture capital round, but by tech mogul standards, he leads a relatively frugal lifestyle. (His Brooklyn loft is <a href=#>worth</a> $1.6 million, but it’s only a one-bedroom.) At least now Karp can afford to go to college, he <a href=#>quipped</a> to The New York Times.<p>(<strong>MORE</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=#>Gambling on Tumblr: Marissa Mayer’s Billion-Dollar Bet to Make Yahoo Cool</a>)</p><strong>Investors: $750 million</strong> <strong></strong>Tumblr’s investors, of course, hit paydirt. New York-based Union Square Ventures and Boston-based Spark Capital led an initial Tumblr investment of $775,000 in 2007,&nbsp;and then added $4.5 million one year later, <a href=#>according</a> to Bloomberg. Together, the firms owned nearly half of Tumblr, and are walking away with a 50-fold return on their investment, making the deal a once-in-a-decade&nbsp;grand slam.&nbsp;Union Square, which is run by Fred Wilson, arguably New York’s most prominent venture capitalist, is making $253 million on the deal, while Spark (including partner Bijan Sabet) is making $231 million, according to PrivCo.<p>Meanwhile, Silicon Valley venture capital titan Sequoia Capital is walking away with $176 million, while four other late stage investors,&nbsp;Greylock Partners, Insight Venture Partners, CrunchFund, and&nbsp;Draper Fisher Jurvetson, are making a combined $88 million, according to PrivCo.</p><p><strong></strong><strong>Tumblr employees:&nbsp;$66 million, or&nbsp;$371,000 each</strong><br><strong></strong>Thanks to stock options, Tumblr’s employees are about to see a few&nbsp;additional&nbsp;zeros on their bank accounts balances. In total, Tumblr’s 178 employees (not including Karp) will divvy up $66 million, according to PrivCo, for an average of $371,000 each. But the company’s earliest employers will reap much more than that: Tumblr’s first 10 employees will see an average payout of $6.2 million each, while the company first 30 employees will make an average of $3.6 million each, according to PrivCo.</p><p>“I won’t make yacht-and-helicopter money from the acquisition, and I won’t be switching to dedicated day and night iPhones,” Marco Arment, Tumblr’s first lead developer, <a href=#>wrote</a> in a blog post. “But as long as I manage investments properly and don’t spend recklessly, Tumblr has given my family a strong safety net and given me the freedom to work on whatever I want. And that’s exactly what I plan to do.”</p><p>The Tumblr deal is also a major milestone for New York’s booming tech scene, because the acquisition represents the first billion-dollar buyout of a venture-backed, Big Apple tech startup, <a href=#>according</a> to venture capital research firm CB Insights. (DoubleClick, the online ad company bought by Google for $3.1 billion, doesn’t count because it had already gone public and was then taken private by private equity firms before the Google sale.) The Tumblr deal beats out Yahoo!’s&nbsp;$850 million acquisition of Right Media in 2007 and Salesforce’s $745 million purchase of Buddy Media in 2012.</p><p>(<strong>MORE</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=#>Marissa Mayer’s Wall Street Debut Sends Yahoo Stock Surging</a>)</p><p>Tumblr’s windfall will only fuel further growth for New York’s tech scene, according to PrivCo CEO Sam Hamadeh.&nbsp;“Most of this money — from the co-founders, to top New York venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, to Tumblr’s 178 employees — will be recycled in the coming months and years into the New York tech startup ecosystem,”&nbsp;Hamadeh <a href=#>said</a> in a blog post. “For Tumblr’s employees, they will go on to start their own companies and create new jobs; David Karp and his co-founders will likely become active angel investors or VCs; and Union Square Ventures will reinvest much of its returns back into the next generation of New York City startups.”</p><p>Most high-profile U.S. tech startup activity and venture capital investing still happens in Silicon Valley, and probably will for some time. But the Tumblr deal represents a major victory for New York’s tech scene, so it’s no surprise that a beaming Mayor <a href=#>Michael Bloomberg</a> was on hand to lavish praise on Karp and his company at Yahoo!’s press event on Monday. Bloomberg&nbsp;has made <a href=#>boosting</a> New York’s tech profile a central part of his legacy, so he was no doubt doubly pleased at Yahoo!’s announcement that it <a href=#>plans</a> to consolidate&nbsp;its New York headquarters in the former New York Times building right off Times Square.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapai2r7HSrGWtoZ2ae6S7zGhpaWljZH12e5FqZqKmo56xpnnYmp%2Bop6Niwba5waWpZpyVlrlutMSrnKxlp528brTIrWStoJVir6q4y6Kmp2WUpLmtrdFmoZqbm6W8tXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
