Becky Hill is one of the few The Voice contenders who successfully made it to the music scene after the show. Let’s get to know her more.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-becky-hill-s-original-beats-are-tiktok-viral>Becky Hill’s Original Beats Are TikTok-Viral</h2><p>From dance covers to quick lifestyle vlogs, Becky Hill’s “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Remember</a>” has definitely appeared on your TikTok For You page. “Remember” is the fourth single off Hill’s debut studio album, Only Honest on the Weekend. Teaming up with French DJ and producer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Guetta</a>, this music collaboration talks about the difficult process of moving on from a past lover.</p><p>While this song is heavily admired by the TikTok community, this is not the only track that Hill popularized in the platform. Her other tune “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lose Control</a>” has gained the same type of exposure on the platform. Keep in mind, many were unaware that this song includes Hill instead of Dua Lipa.</p><p>Italian production trio Meduza worked with Hill on this release, amassing more than 770 million streams on Spotify. In addition, TikTok users loved its upbeat vibe and carefree implication. Like “Remember,” “Lose Control” is a smash hit, reaching even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">K-pop idols</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Joined The Voice UK Season 1</h2><p>For those who may not know, Becky Hill rose to fame as part of The Voice UK season one. During Blind Auditions, she sang to John Legend’s “Ordinary People” which was apparently composed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">will.i.am</a>, a judge in the series. She proceeded to the next round with coach Jessie J.</p><p>Hill’s journey on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice UK</a> was relatively short as she got eliminated in the Semi-Finals. Nevertheless, she has proven herself throughout her stint in the show, moving audiences and judges in her every performance.</p><p>Arguably, Becky Hill might be one of the most acclaimed singers that The Voice has ever produced. Up to date, she is the first and only contestant in the series that obtained a UK no. 1 single with “Gecko (Overdrive).”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Has She Been Up To Now?</h2><p>Just recently, Hill has released multiple versions of “Remember.” Such include the original version, acoustic sped up, acoustic, and David Guetta VIP remix.</p><p>Meanwhile, the singer has expressed how touched she is that media personality and socialite Kim Kardashian used “Remember” on TikTok. The Voice UK alum also guest performed on <a href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a> with medley of her best hits.</p><p>Hill might have curated a fanbase and her songs might have been internationally admired, but she certainly deserves more recognition. With her genius creativity, this artist is slowly making her way to the mainstream.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Original_HunterGirl_AmericanIdol_Momodu-MansarayGetty-Images.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Runner-Up HunterGirl Releases Music Video for ‘Hometown Out of Me’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>becky hill</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the voice uk</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GgrGWknbJuws6imp5lpaB6tMDAq2ScqpWWwaawjLKmrqpdm663u9Giq55lpJ64tbvKZqqoppdk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
