The revelation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby’s gender is&nbsp;a&nbsp;momentous milestone for any <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, often celebrated with enthusiasm and love. However, not all journeys into parenthood unfold seamlessly, and for some, the path is&nbsp;marked by&nbsp;unforeseen obstacles.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;all started in&nbsp;a&nbsp;gender reveal party.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/664/8f8/e4e5b35b0d93d1f9a11dd79523.jpg><p>My&nbsp;wife and&nbsp;I held a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gender reveal</a> for our first child yesterday. It&nbsp;was my&nbsp;wife’s idea since she, her parents, and a&nbsp;few other people wanted to&nbsp;know the gender. I&nbsp;don’t really care what gender it&nbsp;is&nbsp;as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;it’s healthy. My&nbsp;MIL and FIL wanted it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy because they always wanted a&nbsp;son but had two daughters instead. My&nbsp;wife also wanted it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy, but only because of&nbsp;her parents. She didn’t really care much either way.</p><p>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very small gathering with just a&nbsp;few <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a> and close family members. After it&nbsp;was revealed that the baby was a&nbsp;girl, my&nbsp;MIL walked away and got very upset, and my&nbsp;FIL looked disappointed. After around ten minutes, I&nbsp;went into the <a href=# title=garden data-link=tag>garden</a> to&nbsp;see my&nbsp;MIL&nbsp;crying. I&nbsp;asked her what was wrong, and she said that she really wanted a&nbsp;grandson.</p><p><h2>Both in-laws didn’t hide their disappointment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a4/705/db7a395bc487712f45974ff284.jpg><p>I&nbsp;told her that&nbsp;I was sorry she was disappointed, but it&nbsp;didn’t really matter that much, and she got really annoyed at&nbsp;me. At&nbsp;this point, my&nbsp;FIL had joined&nbsp;us and heard what&nbsp;I said to&nbsp;her. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;I should be&nbsp;sad, too, since&nbsp;I wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;teach the baby about cars (I’m a&nbsp;mechanic, and&nbsp;I joked a&nbsp;few times about getting the baby to&nbsp;follow in&nbsp;my&nbsp;footsteps). I&nbsp;told him that she might be&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;cars when she’s older, so&nbsp;I don’t really understand how that’s relevant.</p><p>They were saying a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;things about what they can’t do&nbsp;now because she’s a&nbsp;girl, like taking her to&nbsp;sports games and teaching her about sports. They said that I’ll be&nbsp;missing out on&nbsp;giving a&nbsp;son “the talk and girls.” I&nbsp;don’t really care that much about that, but what if&nbsp;the baby likes girls, their argument is&nbsp;pretty weak.</p><p><h2>His wife didn’t agree with his action.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/011/09e/0bfb57535a93238e99e35cfbd9.jpg><p>They said a&nbsp;few other things about why they wanted her to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy, but&nbsp;I just walked away and went back inside.</p><p>My&nbsp;MIL and FIL explained the whole argument to&nbsp;my&nbsp;wife, and she got really upset with&nbsp;me. She said that&nbsp;I should’ve comforted them and had at&nbsp;least a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;sympathy. I&nbsp;just don’t understand why the gender is&nbsp;such a&nbsp;big deal. Shouldn’t they just be&nbsp;happy they’re getting a&nbsp;grandchild?</p><p><h2>But people comforted this father-to-be.</h2></p><ul><li>“Mom of&nbsp;3&nbsp;girls here: I&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;playing sports and knew way more about sports and cars than my&nbsp;ex&nbsp;did. In&nbsp;fact, my&nbsp;girls have been to&nbsp;Lakers and Dodgers games many times and KNOW the sports and most of&nbsp;the rules: ages 4,7,11. Girls love what they are exposed to&nbsp;and find interest&nbsp;in. Boys love what they’re exposed to&nbsp;and find interest&nbsp;in. Period. Good for you.<br>Your wife has clearly bought into their pity party, and I’d suggest having a&nbsp;serious conversation with her soon.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>SorryRestaurant3421&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“They were invited to&nbsp;a&nbsp;celebration of&nbsp;your baby, and this behavior is&nbsp;not normal for upcoming grandparents. Some private disappointment over the gender could be&nbsp;forgiven, but to&nbsp;need consoling over the gender of&nbsp;your baby girl is&nbsp;absolutely ridiculous and offensive.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Leading-Lake6007&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/010/2da/cb4d2f5111a9f2f13c14759a83.jpg><ul><li>“It’s a&nbsp;baby, and it’s yours and their daughter’s. They should be&nbsp;delighted. If&nbsp;they wanted a&nbsp;boy, they should, at&nbsp;most, be&nbsp;slightly disappointed. They’re instead assigning gender roles and moaning because ’girls can’t do&nbsp;X, girls can’t do&nbsp;Y,’ etc. They don’t deserve comfort or&nbsp;sympathy for placing imaginary limits on&nbsp;your daughter. This implies they did the same to&nbsp;your wife.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>extinct_diplodocus</a><br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>/ Reddit</a></li><li>“It&nbsp;doesn’t sound as&nbsp;though there are any intelligent reasons for them preferring the boy they’re not going to&nbsp;get, so&nbsp;you won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;<a href=# title=logic data-link=tag>logic</a> them out of&nbsp;their position. Just ignore the whole thing. They’ll fall in&nbsp;love with the new grandbaby, or&nbsp;they won’t.<br>Your own attitude is&nbsp;exactly as&nbsp;it&nbsp;should&nbsp;be, so&nbsp;I wish you and your wife all the best with your new tiny person. I&nbsp;think it’s beyond rude to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;gender reveal when you *care* so&nbsp;desperately about the outcome. Stay away, and keep your triumph or&nbsp;disappointment out of&nbsp;the parents’ view.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>YourLittleRuth&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p>The conclusion of&nbsp;this story is&nbsp;not merely the resolution of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fight, but a&nbsp;proof of&nbsp;the enduring spirit of&nbsp;parental love. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder that while external opinions may cast shadows, the intensity of&nbsp;a&nbsp;family’s unity can disperse even the darkest clouds. In&nbsp;the end, it&nbsp;becomes evident that the joy of&nbsp;welcoming a&nbsp;new life into the world transcends <a href=#>societal norms</a> and expectations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecinZKWZp6h6or7EZqypq5WpeqKuzq6rZqWpYq%2BirtisZKCdnpmys3nAp5tmoV2ptaq6ymaroZ2pYrWiwsRmnqimlWLBsLuMn5irZWhmg3eDmGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
