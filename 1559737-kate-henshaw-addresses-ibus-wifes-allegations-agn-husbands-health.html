Most times some people don’t even go for meetings or make monthly or quarterly contributions to the association. "Mr Ibu’s wife is the problem here just early this year she came out on social media accusing lady Jasmine of snatching her husband from her and how Mr Ibu beats her all in the name of clout. My brothers when looking for a wife find a lady who can rally round for you without causing you more pain.
