They learned during a red carpet interview that they had won the award for Best New Alternative Artist.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-maneskin-wins-at-2022-iheartradio-music-awards>Måneskin Wins at 2022 iHeartRadio Music Awards</h2><p>Måneskin was nominated for three awards at the event, including Best New Pop Artist and TikTok Bop of the Year for “Beggin’.” They didn’t win those two categories, but they did win the award for Best New Alternative Artist.</p><p>The band’s frontman Damiano David&nbsp;said it’s always “surprising” for the band to be honored in the United States. He said they “hope to win,” but added that “it’s not the most important thing,” and that being nominated is an honor in itself.</p><p>That’s when their interviewers surprised them with the news that they had won the award for Best New Alternative Artist and presented them with their trophy.</p><p>“Thank you, everybody, for letting us win this amazing award,” David said to thank the band’s fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbbqX7lFJgT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>JENNIFER LOPEZ, JOHN LEGEND TO PERFORM AT IHEARTRADIO MUSIC AWARDS</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-band-also-performed-at-the-event>The Band Also Performed at the Event</h2><p>Måneskin took the stage during Tuesday’s awards to perform their songs “Beggin'” and “I Wanna Be Your Slave.” In addition to David on vocals, the band includes bassist Victoria De Angelis, guitarist Thomas Raggi, and drummer Ethan Torchio.</p><p>The band first performed a cover of “Beggin'” by the Four Seasons during the eleventh season of the Italian X Factor in 2017. They finished the competition in second place and released an EP later that year. They released their first full studio album in 2018, in addition to a documentary called This Is Måneskin.</p><p>Last year was big for the band, as they won the Sanremo Music Festival and released their second studio album. They represented Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest with their song “Zitti e buoni.” The band went on to win the contest, giving Italy its third victory.</p><p>In November, Måneskin performed during the Top 10 live show on The Voice Season 21. They’ll return to Eurovision this year to perform as the reigning champions before a new winner is crowned.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MEGA-1.png alt="Matthew Lawrence Asks Judge to Terminate Spousal Support in Divorce From Cheryl Burke" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>iHeartRadio Music Awards</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Maneskin</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xK6pqK6ZqLawuoycn5qloJ68r7%2BMppinnaOgtq951qKlZpmkYsGpsYyin56Zoqm%2ForDIqGSmraOesG6t1pqpnatf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
