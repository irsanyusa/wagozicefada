Uldine Utley, a dozen years ago the protegee of Manhattan’s late, reforming Baptist John Roach Straton, and for the past two years a Methodist minister in good standing (TIME, Dec. 30, 1935). Small, blonde and decidedly the most comely of U. S. divines, Miss Utley has been called by newspapers the “Garbo of the Pulpit” and the “Terror of the Tabernacles”; by Dr. Straton the “Joan of Arc of the modern religious world.” This reverend miss once declared: “If I were a man, I’d never marry a woman preacher. They declaim too much.” But two years ago a shoe salesman named Wilbur Eugene Langkop heard Evangelist Utley preach in Quincy, 111., drove her to Hannibal, Mo., followed her thereafter on the preaching tours she makes in the Midwest, since she has no permanent pastorate. Ignoring her advice, Salesman Langkop last week plighted his troth to the Terror of the Tabernacles in Manhattan’s famed Episcopal Little Church Around the Corner.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I was probably influenced by the romance,” said Evangelist Utley in explaining why she married in a church not of her own denomination. She instructed the Little Church’s organist, however, to play her favorite revival songs — Rose of Sharon, In My Heart There Rings a Melody—during the ceremony. Rev. Randolph Ray, urbane rector of the Little Church, appeared pleased at the chance to officiate for a “lady evangelist.” Afterwards Mr. and Mrs. Langkop went to Old John Street Methodist Church, in downtown Manhattan, where she slipped on a black robe, assisted at the wedding of her 21-year-old sister Ovella to Robert P. Long, who had been publicity director at the revival meetings Miss Utley conducted during Chicagp’s Century of Progress exposition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ubnBhZYVwvsSloKChn6N6tbHRq6arq12pv7DAx2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
