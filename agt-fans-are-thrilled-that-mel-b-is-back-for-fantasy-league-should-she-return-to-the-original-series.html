Her return comes nearly 4 years since her final season. With her much-anticipated comeback, fans are clearly excited about what she has to offer.</strong></p><p>During the first episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent Fantasy League</a>, Mel B reunited with Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, and Howie Mandel. Due to her return, fans are wondering if there’s a chance she’ll return to the original franchise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-are-happy-that-mel-b-is-back-for-america-s-got-talent-fantasy-league>Fans are Happy that Mel B is Back for America’s Got Talent: Fantasy League</h2><p>Mel first became a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">judge on America’s Got Talent </a>season eight back in 2013. She then maintained the same duty on the judging panel for five more seasons. In 2018, however, the Spice Girl departed from the show due to other professional commitments.</p><p>The singer-songwriter then came back during season one of America’s Got Talent: The Champions. Unfortunately, she didn’t return for season two of the spinoff series, revealing she “swap the Hollywood lifestyle” to move back to her hometown of Leeds in Northern England.</p><p>Hence, now that she came back as judge of Fantasy League, fans are delighted to witness in the AGT screen once more. On Reddit, several fans expressed their pleasure over Mel’s return.</p><p>“Let’s go I’ve missed her,” one user commented.</p><p>“Unpopular opinion but I love her this makes me so happy,” one fan wrote.</p><p>“I wonder why she left the show in the first place,” another person wrote.</p><p>Unlike the original series, AGT: Fantasy League pits judges against each other. In the spinoff, the four members of the panel have created their own roster of acts, from a pool of 40 previous performers.</p><p>For those who may not know, music mogul Cowell asked recurring judge Sofia Vergara to join but she apparently “couldn’t do it.” Soon after the Modern Family star refused, he knew immediately who could fill the spot.</p><p>“When we spoke about who would be the best fourth judge, everyone said Mel. She’s a lot of fun and she’s really smart,” he revealed. “She did such a brilliant job with the Spice Girls, and you don’t know what to expect with her. So, it’s going to be interesting.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-should-she-return-to-agt>Should She Return to AGT?</h2><p>From just witnessing Mel B competitiveness on Fantasy League, we already know she deserves a spot on the show. She is indeed an added value to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent</a>, so we definitely want to see more of her should there be more seasons of the spinoff.</p><p>Yet, given Mel’s history of America’s Got Talent, it’s not bad to hope that she’ll be back in the original series. Some fans do wish that she’ll come back in the next season of AGT.</p><p>If you’ve been a viewer of AGT for years, you probably know that the former Spice Girl is one of the toughest female judges in the show’s history. She provides constructive criticisms when necessary. She began as an easy judge but later established much confidence as a judge. Overall, Mel is not easy to impress, but with the right act surely can.</p><p>If she’ll ever come back as judge in the original series, she will absolutely be a welcomed personality in the panel. For now though, let’s see how she and her roster will do on Fantasy League.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Original_PaulaAbdul_-Harmony-Gerber_Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Paula Abdul Accuses ‘American Idol’ Producer Nigel Lythgoe of Sexual Assault" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZp6Ro8BurdGeZK2gop65rbHDZquhmaRiuqa4jJtkoqtdl66kt4yfpqtllpa7ta3SsmSlnZGcwqZ50qGmrqSUYsCpsYyrnK2toqN6tbuMrZ%2BeZZ%2Bntqi1zZqjZquVp7amv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
