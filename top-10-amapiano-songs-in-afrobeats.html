'Hallelu' by <strong>Masterkraft</strong> feat <strong>Bella</strong> <strong>Shmurda</strong> & <strong>Zlatan</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This single found immediate success on the streets which quickly spilled into the charts.

'Highway' by<strong> DJ Kaywise</strong> feat <strong>Phyno</strong></p><p>This song dominated 2021 as it spent consecutive weeks in the top 10 of TurnTable Top 50 (now top 100). Phyno's versatility was on full display as he wowed listeners through his smooth line and catchy lyrics that combined for a hit song.</p><p>8. 'Of Lagos' by <strong>Mayorkun</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Credited as one of the earliest Amapiano records by a Nigerian artist, Mayorkun's sticky lines, easy delivery, and infectious melody made the song a listeners' favorite. It's also credited for bringing the Amapiano record to the mainstream.</p><p>7. 'Ko Por Ke' by <strong>Rexxie</strong> feat <strong>Mohbad</strong></p><p>This is an incredible dance record from a super producer who is skilled in delivering hit songs. Rexxie's 'KPK' quickly became a slang that engulfed the street and pop culture while also serving as a party-starting record whose success was evident in its enduring run on the charts.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>6. 'Palazzo' by <strong>Spinall</strong> feat <strong>Asake</strong></p><p>One of the defining tracks of his 2022 unprecedented run of hits, 'Palazzo' spread like a virus infecting everyone in sight.

'Sungba' by <strong>Asake</strong></p><p>One of the best performing Afrobeats records of 2022, 'Sungba' and the Burna Boy remix showcases the heights Amapiano can reach in Afrobeats when deployed by supremely talented artists.
