She suffered profoundly during 1939-1945.</p><p><h2>2.

Hepburn <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>visited</a> areas where children and families needed food, clean water, and immunization, such as&nbsp;Turkey, Ecuador, Honduras, Sudan, Bangladesh, and Somalia.

She even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>labeled</a> herself an&nbsp;introvert. She was once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>quoted</a> as&nbsp;saying, “I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;alone very often.

Dotti said, “She thought she had a&nbsp;big nose and big feet, and she was too skinny and didn’t have enough breasts. She would look in&nbsp;the mirror and say, ’I don’t understand why people see me&nbsp;as&nbsp;beautiful.’”</p><p><h2>5.

What is&nbsp;in&nbsp;other people’s minds is&nbsp;not in&nbsp;my&nbsp;mind. I&nbsp;just do&nbsp;my&nbsp;thing.”</p><p>She also considered her style to&nbsp;be&nbsp;quite <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accessible</a>. “My&nbsp;appearance is&nbsp;accessible to&nbsp;everyone. With hair tied in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bun, big sunglasses, and a&nbsp;black dress, every woman can look like&nbsp;me,” she said.</p><p><h2>7.

During the ceremony, Hepburn was praised, as&nbsp;her “work with the International Children’s Emergency Fund put her in&nbsp;our hearts.” Unfortunately, the actor could not attend the ceremony due to&nbsp;health reasons. She passed away the following year.</p><p>Audrey Hepburn went through hell and back but came out a&nbsp;better and stronger woman. Which of&nbsp;these facts amazed you the most?
