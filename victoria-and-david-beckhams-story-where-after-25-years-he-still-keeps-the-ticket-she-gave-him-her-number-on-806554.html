Then, we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;face the difficult task of&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;life partner. But this story has a&nbsp;twist: some couples did manage to&nbsp;get the happy ending we&nbsp;all long for.</p><p>That’s what Victoria and <a href=# title="David Beckham" data-link=tag>David Beckham</a> have proven at&nbsp;the very least. Even years later, David still keeps the ticket Victoria wrote down her number&nbsp;on, reminding&nbsp;us that when the ideal person arrives, <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> is&nbsp;eternal.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;believe that when there is&nbsp;love, it’s possible to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;happy <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, and that’s why we&nbsp;loved learning more about the story behind this iconic couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3aa/eb1/a675d258649921573517ea4319.jpg><p>Victoria and David Beckham are one of&nbsp;the most iconic and enduring celebrity couples. They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> in&nbsp;1997 and have been together ever since. Perhaps many of&nbsp;us know them for their coordinated looks, their elegance, or&nbsp;the career that brought each of&nbsp;them to&nbsp;fame. But without a&nbsp;doubt, the Beckhams are also known for proving that love can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;an&nbsp;industry where stable relationships don’t seem to&nbsp;last.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c5/27f/af36315e2eaedbb9ca3c4ce957.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 1990s, <a href=# title="Victoria Adams" data-link=tag>Victoria Adams</a> achieved international fame thanks to&nbsp;the Spice Girls, while David Beckham was making a&nbsp;name for himself at&nbsp;Manchester United. Although she had no&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>idea</a> who the soccer player was, David knew “Posh Spice” very well.</p><p>He&nbsp;actually <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;her. “I&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hotel room with my&nbsp;best friend, who was my&nbsp;best man at&nbsp;my&nbsp;wedding, and&nbsp;I remember turning around before&nbsp;I met Victoria and saying, ’I want to&nbsp;marry her. The girl in&nbsp;the black dress and the bob cut.’”</p><p>Soon after, Victoria attended one of&nbsp;David’s games, and he&nbsp;waved to&nbsp;her from afar. And although he&nbsp;thought he&nbsp;had missed his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chance</a> to&nbsp;date his favorite Spice Girl, the world gave him a&nbsp;second chance a&nbsp;week later when Victoria attended a&nbsp;match with her manager and one of&nbsp;her band members. It&nbsp;was at&nbsp;this 1997 party that David got up&nbsp;the nerve to&nbsp;ask Posh Spice for her number.</p><p>“We&nbsp;talked for about an&nbsp;hour in&nbsp;the players’ lounge. She had actually taken the train that day, so&nbsp;she wrote down her number on&nbsp;her train ticket, which&nbsp;I still have,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> the soccer star.</p><p>Remembering that very same moment, Victoria wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;her teenage self, titled, “What I&nbsp;Wish I’d Known,” and in&nbsp;it, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tells</a> the story of&nbsp;how she fell in&nbsp;love with David.</p><p>“Love at&nbsp;first sight does exist. It&nbsp;will happen to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;the Manchester United players’ lounge [...] As&nbsp;the other soccer players stand with their mates, you’ll see David standing off to&nbsp;the side with his family. And he&nbsp;has such a&nbsp;nice smile... You’re very close to&nbsp;your family, too, and you’ll think about how comfortable he&nbsp;is&nbsp;with you. He’s going to&nbsp;ask for your number.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c0/c57/19f1b3579bb97972d26ddc8f58.jpg><p>They began their <a href=# title=romance data-link=tag>romance</a> hidden from the public eye at&nbsp;the request of&nbsp;Victoria’s manager. Therefore, in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>beginning</a>, their dates consisted of&nbsp;going to&nbsp;a&nbsp;parking lot to&nbsp;talk and spend time together. Although we&nbsp;know that fame was already part of&nbsp;their lives, their relationship developed like any other. The soccer player <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that their first kiss happened one day when they were on&nbsp;their way to&nbsp;his parents’ house.</p><p>The couple made the decision to&nbsp;marry when the then-singer was in&nbsp;the United States. “I&nbsp;had told him what my&nbsp;dream ring would&nbsp;be. He&nbsp;remembered and had it&nbsp;designed especially for&nbsp;me,” she said. One night in&nbsp;January 1998, the couple was at&nbsp;the Rookery Hall Hotel in&nbsp;the U.K., where she was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>greeted</a> with 30&nbsp;roses and then escorted to&nbsp;the room David had decorated with hundreds of&nbsp;roses and red and yellow lilies.</p><p>They sat down to&nbsp;dinner and that’s where David finally got down on&nbsp;his knee to&nbsp;propose with the dream ring. “I&nbsp;said yes, then pulled out my&nbsp;own ring and said, ’Don’t forget about girl power, will you marry me?’” Victoria recounted.</p><p>In&nbsp;1999, the big day arrived. They were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> at&nbsp;the elegant Luttrellstown Castle in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Robin Hood-<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>themed</a> wedding. At&nbsp;the event, their son, Brooklyn, who was 4&nbsp;months old at&nbsp;the time, was the ring bearer at&nbsp;the altar. In&nbsp;addition, that same year, they bought a&nbsp;luxurious home that the press dubbed the “Beckingham Palace.”</p><p>Currently, the couple has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>4</a>&nbsp;children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. Although the Beckhams travel a&nbsp;lot for their careers and charity work, they say they always find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;spend time as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. “We&nbsp;swap. When I’m at&nbsp;home, he’s away, so&nbsp;one of&nbsp;us is&nbsp;always there taking care of&nbsp;the kids,” Victoria said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc0/0e7/511e21534496a767a380ea0680.jpg><p>Although the press often invents rumors about the couple’s divorce, time has shown&nbsp;us that these do&nbsp;not affect the Beckhams’ relationship. Victoria <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>assures</a>&nbsp;us that she doesn’t pay attention to&nbsp;what the media says, explaining, “David and&nbsp;I have nothing to&nbsp;prove. We&nbsp;love each other, look out for each other and are strong as&nbsp;both partners and parents.”</p><p>Something undeniable is&nbsp;the love they feel for each other because after sharing more than 20&nbsp;years together, the couple continues to&nbsp;show how much they admire each other. Victoria has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that David constantly inspires and guides her: “He&nbsp;has done so&nbsp;much good work, I&nbsp;look up&nbsp;to&nbsp;him and have the utmost respect and admiration for all that he&nbsp;has achieved.”</p><p>“I’m proud of&nbsp;her because she works so&nbsp;hard. She is&nbsp;so&nbsp;dedicated; she deserves success,” David once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> of&nbsp;his wife. “I&nbsp;love her for many reasons, but the main one is&nbsp;because she gave me&nbsp;the most amazing children,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>assured</a>.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think is&nbsp;the key to&nbsp;having a&nbsp;lasting relationship? If&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;partner, what do&nbsp;you admire about them?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMOqr9OoqaKZXZa7pXnDmq2inF2XsqS3x5qkrGWjqbyzxYywn56qlWKup8DEq2RrbV2usqK%2B0mafnmWjqbatuIyknJ6oo2LBqbGMraCco5WperS0xGaemq6VYrWquYyhnKtlnqq6o7HRZqanZWhlg3aBk2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
