The two went against each other in another song-related game, two years after Hathaway beat Clarkson in a game featuring her own song.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-clarkson-forgets-song-in-game-with-anne-hathaway>Kelly Clarkson Forgets Song in Game with Anne Hathaway</h2><p>During Hathaway’s appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, she and the host played a game called “Pop Pop Quiz.” They were tasked with answering trivia questions about song lyrics. Hathaway ended up winning, but there was one question Clarkson answered correctly — sort of.</p><p>“As we’ve witnessed, Kelly Clarkson doesn’t always know her own lyrics,” game host Amber Ruffin read. “But that’s OK, because what doesn’t kill you makes you a fighter, and makes your footsteps even… what?”</p><p>Clarkson buzzed in and answered, “Lighter! That’s Christina Aguilera!” She was right about the lyric, but wrong about the singer. That lyric is actually from her own song, “Stronger.” The host realized this later in the show.</p><p>“I thought I was singing Christina Aguilera’s song ‘Fighter,'” Clarkson said through laughter. “And I was singing mine, ‘Stronger.’ It’s one of those days.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ANNE HATHAWAY IDENTIFIES KELLY CLARKSON’S OWN SONG BEFORE SHE DOES IN FUNNY GAME</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-clarkson-has-forgotten-her-own-song-in-the-past>Clarkson Has Forgotten Her Own Song in the Past</h3><p>When Hathaway was a guest on Clarkson’s show in 2022, they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">played a similar game</a> called “Sing That Name That Tune.” They had to identify which songs were playing and then perform them. One of the songs was “Since U Been Gone” by none other than Kelly Clarkson.</p><p>Hathaway beat Clarkson to identifying the track, prompting Clarkson to jokingly collapse and lie face down as the actress performed the song. As Hathaway said, “Kelly Clarkson, if you do not understand how much we all love that song…”</p><p>During this week’s show, Clarkson described Hathaway as her “kryptonite.” Which of her own songs will she forget the next time the actress is a guest on the show?
