Although, in her Instagram post announcing the divorce, she firmly denied that.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“As many would love to assume, throughout our life as a couple, I was the only married wife to him. There were side attractions, but it was never an issue." She said.</p><p>We asked a sage Ifa consultant, practitioner and Òrìshà initiation activist <strong>Awò Òyèkúfùn</strong> if these speculations about marrying 13 wives were true.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>Is it prescribed by Ifa?</h2></p><p>He<strong> </strong>said that the Ooni can marry up to 16 women, but it is not compulsory after a divorce that he marries so many women in such quick succession. It’s not tradition (to his knowledge) for the Ooni of Ife to marry 13 wives because of one divorce.</p><p>We also asked <strong>Awolade</strong>, a practising Babalawo who believes in Olódùmarè, Ifá teachings and Òrìsà if it’s the tradition for the Ooni of Ife to marry 13 wives upon one divorce. He said, “I can't say because I am not a member of Ọọni Ifa Priests.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>What culture says</h2></p><p>Another reason why the Ooni might be marrying many wives is, it is against Yoruba culture for the Ooni of Ife to just have one wife. He can also divorce any woman he finds disrespectful.</p><p>It is believed that one wife might become too proud and might even try to usurp authority from him. Also, having many wives is believed to prevent him from wandering and having sexual relations with many women.</p><p>The Ooni of Ife said during his recent 48th birthday celebration that his plan was to have one wife and many concubines, but the institution of monarchy is beyond him.</p><p>“This institution is bigger than me, beyond me. People in this palace are more than 800, they are close to a thousand. There are some people who have been living in this palace for more than 60 years, while some have lived here for more than 80 years. Some people are over 100 years old in this Palace.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"If I had my way, I tried to challenge it but it blew in my face thank God I’m still alive. It’s an institution that is rich in heritage, culture, and tradition.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cMDHnmSrnZGovK%2B%2FjJucoaGemXq1tMRmpqimmWK8p3nIn5ysZZ2Wu7p5zJqpq6GRnLK0e5ZyaZxtl6w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
