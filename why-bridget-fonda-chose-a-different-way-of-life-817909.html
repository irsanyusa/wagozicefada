After she retired from acting in&nbsp;2002, it&nbsp;has been more than 22&nbsp;years since she last graced the screen.</p><p><h2>Bridget didn’t just retire; she disappeared.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/221/374/ae613358c5a429c54e7459dd6b.jpg><p>Mary Evans/AF Archive/Graham Whitby Boot/East News</p><p></p><p>Fonda acted in&nbsp;so&nbsp;many movies during her short time in&nbsp;the spotlight, about 15&nbsp;years or&nbsp;so. What’s interesting is&nbsp;that she had a&nbsp;really cool acting career, but then it&nbsp;just suddenly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stopped</a>.</p><p>Unlike some other celebrities who <a href=# title=retire data-link=tag>retire</a> or&nbsp;switch to&nbsp;different things like making fancy candles, Fonda didn’t make a&nbsp;big deal about leaving. <strong>She just disappeared from the scene without any fuss</strong>. Her last big movie was <i>Kiss of&nbsp;the Dragon</i> in&nbsp;2001, which did really well at&nbsp;the box office. There wasn’t a&nbsp;slow decline in&nbsp;her career like some other actors.</p><p>That’s why people sometimes wonder why she vanished.</p><p><h2>She was never happy with her successful acting careeer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d86/748/2e96cb58b0a62c92cde2d7e784.jpg><p>Throughout her career, she often felt uneasy talking about herself, like wearing a&nbsp;scratchy sweater that she didn’t choose. Once, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, she wondered aloud about her lack of&nbsp;confidence, saying, «<strong>I’m trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy with my&nbsp;career</strong>. I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I should give myself a&nbsp;break, but I’ve got this bug that rides&nbsp;me, ‘You should be&nbsp;doing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>better</a>.’» She opened up&nbsp;that every time she worked, she was frustrated with her physical inability to&nbsp;catch up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her mental picture.</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;others who succeeded without family connections in&nbsp;showbiz, she admitted when she saw people from non-showbiz families making&nbsp;it, she was impressed by&nbsp;their efforts. But she struggled to&nbsp;credit herself because she always considered nepotism as&nbsp;a&nbsp;factor.</p><p><h2>She decided to&nbsp;build her life as&nbsp;she imagined&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d79/f19/b2c6e75bea954639032620b0c4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her final big <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interviews</a>, she shared a&nbsp;story that seemed to&nbsp;explain everything that happened afterwards: her sudden stop in&nbsp;acting, disappearing from the spotlight, and choosing a&nbsp;regular life. It&nbsp;was in&nbsp;early 1997, she remembered, when she was really sick with the flu. She fell into a&nbsp;deep sadness, crying over simple things like the brightness of&nbsp;the sunlight outside her window, without understanding why. Finally, feeling overwhelmed, <strong>she reached out to&nbsp;her mom for support</strong>.</p><p><strong>Her mom explained</strong> that Bridget’s feelings were normal at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain point in&nbsp;life when you realize that life doesn’t just happen to&nbsp;you; you have to&nbsp;actively create&nbsp;it. And when you consider&nbsp;it, whether we&nbsp;agree or&nbsp;not, she kind of&nbsp;did just that.</p><p><h2>After the car crash, she disappeared.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c60/f97/51dd8f560e96f6171415ecab07.jpg><p>face to face/REPORTER/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;2002, Bridget decided to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>retire</a> from acting to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;her relationship and start a&nbsp;family. She <strong>married famous musician Danny Elfman in&nbsp;2003</strong>, and they welcomed their son, Oliver, in&nbsp;2005. Since then, Bridget has mostly kept a&nbsp;low profile and stayed away from Hollywood, although she’s occasionally seen here and there.</p><p>On&nbsp;February&nbsp;28, 2003, Bridget had a&nbsp;scary experience when<strong> she lost control of&nbsp;her car</strong>, and it&nbsp;flipped down a&nbsp;hill. Despite the car being completely wrecked, Bridget only suffered minor cuts and bruises, according to&nbsp;The New York Post. Her seat belt is&nbsp;credited with saving her life.</p><p><h2>Being an&nbsp;ordinary person is&nbsp;better than being a&nbsp;celebrity for her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ea/2e2/85a7c45b51a9b6a03ecfa0481e.jpg><p>EAST NEWS<span>, </span>Mary Evans/Allstar/Graham Whitby Boot/East News</p><p>Bridget is&nbsp;embracing her everyday life, as&nbsp;she describes&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;April 2023, she was seen in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare public appearance coming out of&nbsp;LAX and getting into a&nbsp;black SUV. <a href=# title=Paparazzi data-link=tag>Paparazzi</a> caught sight of&nbsp;her and asked if&nbsp;she had any interest in&nbsp;returning to&nbsp;Hollywood to&nbsp;make another movie, to&nbsp;which she replied with a&nbsp;simple, «No.»</p><p>When pressed further, Bridget <a href=#>explained</a> that <strong>she finds being an&nbsp;ordinary person too enjoyable to&nbsp;consider going back to&nbsp;acting</strong>.</p><p>Being a&nbsp;celebrity isn’t always as&nbsp;glamorous as&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems from the outside. While fame may bring recognition and success, it&nbsp;also comes with a&nbsp;<a href=#>price</a>.
