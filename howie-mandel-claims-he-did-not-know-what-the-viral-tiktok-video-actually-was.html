Mandel brought up the reasons that led him to post the now-infamous TikTok video during his guest appearance on the H3 Podcast.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mandel-insists-the-viral-video-was-a-mistake>Mandel Insists the Viral Video Was a Mistake</h2><p>The AGT judge recently made a guest appearance on H3 Podcast, a popular YouTube podcast hosted by Ethan and Hila Klein. Throughout the entirety of the episode, Mandel was admittedly uncomfortable as the topic leaned toward his viral TikTok video.</p><p>As <a href=# class=broken_link>the podcast</a>‘s hosts introduced Mandel, the comedian revealed his nervousness at being a guest on the podcast. The husband and wife hosts of the show are known to satirize internet culture and popular news on the web. Mandel’s viral TikTok video is an especially interesting topic for the hosts to pass up.</p><p>Originally meant as a joke from Mandel, the video he shared showing his friend’s prolapsed rectum shocked the internet. His reasoning for posting the graphic content was that he thought it was a “wet cake,” that was on his friend’s behind.</p><p>“I did not know what it was. I just thought randomly that I’m gonna put up this gross picture and I’m gonna go, ‘is this Covid related?'” Mandel said.</p><p>The AGT judge insists that what happened was a mistake. He didn’t intend for this video to be problematic. Whatever the case may be, Mandel’s<a href=#> TikTok</a> fiasco will remain etched in history as one of the most shocking posts on the streaming app.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Are Not Buying It, They Believe it Wasn’t a Mistake</h2><p>The viewers of the podcast didn’t buy into the reasons that led Mandel to share the graphic video. Fans pointed out that it couldn’t have been a mistake when the man featured in the video is Mandel’s friend.</p><p>“Why did he say ‘when my friend Neil bent over’ and ‘ow’ if he didn’t know it was a prolapse though?” a fan commented.</p><p>The fan makes a valid point in commenting that Mandel did mention his friend’s name and saying “ow,” at the end of the deleted video. Furthermore, most fans couldn’t accept Mandel’s explanations, and I agree that they sounded more like excuses to save face.</p><p>Mandel’s guest appearance certainly helped shed some light about his side of the story. Although many may not believe the AGT judges’ reasoning, he has officially made a statement about it.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_CherylBurke_-Unique-NicoleWireImage-220x197.jpg alt="Cheryl Burke Is Leaving ‘Dancing with the Stars’ After This Season" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuop1doq6vsMSlZJykkZ66tHnHnmSdoZRiu7DAjKSlqK9drLWiwIytn55lpp6%2ForiMraCkrJ%2Bgere1w56mZpmTqcKiuMuyZLCZo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
