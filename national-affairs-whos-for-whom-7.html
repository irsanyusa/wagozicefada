Unopposed on the G.O.P. ballot, Native Son Nixon nevertheless attracted 59% of the registered Republicans to the polls for a rousing 1,475,595 vote of confidence—despite an attempt by Rockefeller outriders to encourage a “silent” stay-away vote. The Democrats polled 53% of their registered vote, but Brown found nothing very cheering in his 1,327,245 vote tally or the fact that his Democratic rival, Old-Age Pension Promoter George McLain, registered a surprising 634,950 total.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">¶ The queen mother of the Democratic Party broke her vow of preconvention silence to endorse a ticket headed by Adlai Stevenson. Acknowledging the commanding lead of Jack Kennedy over Stevenson and all other Democratic candidates (see box), Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, 75, nevertheless hoped that in the light of the summit blowup.

Signers: Harvard’s Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and John K. Galbraith, Amherst’s Henry Steele Commager and Washington Lawyer Joseph Rauh, onetime chairman of Americans for Democratic Action. In Manhattan, a regiment of eggheads closed the gap in their ranks with a Draft Stevenson Committee, signed a loyalty pledge supporting their favorite candidate. Among the signers: Poets Carl Sandburg and Archibald MacLeish. Authors John Steinbeck and John Hersey, Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, Critic John Mason Brown, Playwright-Producer George Abbott, Composer-Conductor Leonard Bernstein.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">¶ The son and widow of Wendell Willkie, the surprise Republican presidential nominee of 1940, jointly endorsed the predictable nominee of 1960, Vice President Nixon. Nixon, said Philip Willkie. is “the best qualified and most experienced man in both foreign and domestic affairs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">¶ In California, Lawyer Murray Chotiner, campaign manager for Dick Nixon in races for Congress, the Senate and the vice-presidency, failed in his own first race for the Republican congressional nomination in the affluent 16th (Beverly Hills) District. After 1956 charges that he had been an influence peddler around Washington, Murray Chotiner abruptly retired from Nixon’s life, campaigned for Congress this spring with glacial silence from Nixon, lost to a soft-hitting wealthy oilman, Alphonzo E. Bell Jr.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">¶ Montana’s Democrats bypassed retiring Senator James E.
