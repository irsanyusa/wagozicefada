The show won’t be on tonight due to the World Series.</strong> <strong>Instead, the show will air on a special night.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-masked-singer-not-on-tonight-due-to-world-series>The Masked Singer Not on Tonight Due to World Series</h2><p>The Masked Singer took to Instagram Wednesday to remind viewers that the show will not be on at its usual time. FOX will be airing a World Series baseball game between the Houston Astros and the Philadelphia Phillies in that time slot.</p><p>Instead, the show encouraged fans to tune in this Sunday, November 6, at 8/7c. The post made sure to add that this is “pending results of the MLB game.” The World Series schedule recently had to be adjusted due to rain. If a seventh game is necessary, it’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly scheduled</a> for Sunday night.</p><p>This would be disappointing for a lot of Masked Singer fans, especially because the show was already <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">preempted by baseball</a> earlier this season, putting the show one episode behind. Interestingly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TV listings</a> currently show two new episodes for this Sunday, starting at 7/6c, possibly to make up for the missed week.</p><p>However, the show’s social media is now telling fans to tune in at 8/7c, and only promoting one episode. It might be a good idea to check your local listings on Sunday just to make sure you don’t miss anything.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">THE BEST ‘MASKED SINGER’ PERFORMANCES IN HONOR OF THE 100TH EPISODE</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-show-is-celebrating-100-episodes>The Show Is Celebrating 100 Episodes</h3><p>Sunday’s new episode of The Masked Singer is a special one, because it’s the 100th episode of the show. Things will be getting nostalgic, as the planned theme for the episode is ’90s Night. In promos for the episode, panelist Jenny McCarthy can be seen dressed as Gwen Stefani.</p><p>Last week, new competitors the Lambs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dethroned Robo Girl (Kat Graham)</a> as Queen of The Masked Singer. They’re moving on to the next episode in the hope of making it to the Semifinals. They’ll go up against two new contestants we’ve never met before — Milkshake and Walrus.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a teaser</a> for the new episode, the panelists can be seen guessing ’90s-appropriate stars like Mario Lopez, Scott Wolf, and John Stamos. We’ll have to wait and see if any of them are right.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_PerrieEdwards_John-PhillipsGetty-Images.jpg alt="Perrie Edwards Veers Away From Pop Music With Unexpected Side Hustle" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6qr%2FNrWSopl2pvK%2B1xqGrZq%2BYmrtuwM5mrpqsk518</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
